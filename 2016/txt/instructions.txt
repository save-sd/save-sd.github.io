All papers must represent original and unpublished work that is not currently under review. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the workshop. Papers are to be submitted through cEasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=savesd2016.

All submissions must be written in English. Two formats are possible for the submission: HTML (which is **strongly** encouraged) and PDF.

## HTML

You can use your own HTML-based format for the submission. In this case, you will be asked to prepare a PDF of your Camera Ready version according to the Springer LNCS layout in order to publish you paper in the LNCS volume dedicated to the proceedings of the workshop.

Alternatively, you can choose to use [*RASH*](http://github.com/essepuntato/rash), the *Research Articles in Simplified HTML* format, that allows one to easily prepare a scientific paper in HTML format. In this case, you should submit a zip archive containing HTML file in RASH with the additional stylesheets and scripts included in the [style package](https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/rash/master/rash.zip) for guaranteeing a correct visualisation of the document on browsers. 

RASH is a XML-based format composed by a few of the available HTML tags and allows one to add RDF annotations by means of Turtle, JSON-LD and RDFa.

The earliest version of the RASH format is fully introduced in its [documentation page](https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/rash/master/documentation/index.html) (written in RASH), which includes several examples. The complete RelaxNG grammar of the language is [available online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/essepuntato/rash/master/grammar/rash.rng). The whole style package of this format (which includes the documentation, the examples and the grammar) is also [available](https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/rash/master/rash.zip) as a ZIP archive. 

Note that now it also possible to **use OpenOffice for preparing your RASH submission**! In order to prepare your paper with OpenOffice, please follow the [instructions](https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/rash/master/documentation/rash-in-odt.odt) available on the RASH repository. Once you prepared your article with OpenOffice, you can convert it into RASH by using either the [ODT to RASH converter](https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/tools/odt2rash/bin) or the [RASH online conversion service](http://dasplab.cs.unibo.it/rocs).

We encourage to use the earliest version of browsers for guaranteeing the best visualisation of the RASH documents. Note that RASH allow one to check if your HTML file is compliant with the 15 pages limit constraint of the workshop, by selecting the LNCS Style from the menu and then by print-viewing or printing to PDF the file.

In addition, the translation from your RASH submission into the appropriate publishing format that will be used in the official proceedings of the workshop **will be totally handled by us** through a semi-automatic process. Thus, if you decided to submit your paper in RASH, only the submission of the zip archive is needed.
