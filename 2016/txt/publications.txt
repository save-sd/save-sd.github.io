All the papers of SAVE-SD will be made available on the workshop website and published in a [Lecture Notes in Computer Science](http://www.springer.com/lncs) volume by [Springer](http://www.springer.com). The LNCS volume will be published after the workshop in order to give the authors an opportunity to revise their papers in the light of the discussions of their works at the workshop. Note that the WWW 2016 organisers will require that at least one of the authors of the papers accepted will be registered at the workshop.

We are also pleased to announce **two** special issues for workshop papers. As in the last edition, the authors of selected **full research papers** of the workshop will be invited to submit an extended version of their works to a special issue that will be published as part of [PeerJ Computer Science](https://peerj.com/computer-science/), a new open access journal in Computer Science published by the award winning open access publisher [PeerJ](https://peerj.com). In addition, this year also the authors of selected **position**, **demo**, and **poster** papers of the workshop will be invited to submit an extended version of their works to a special issue that will be published as part of the [Research Ideas and Outcomes (RIO) Journal](http://riojournal.com/).
