            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>This paper explores the possibility of promoting knowledge export by means
                of citation function indexing using <em>CiTO</em>, the Citation
                Typing Ontology <a href="#shotton-2015"> </a>. Instances of knowledge export are
                exemplified by cross-disciplinary citations, which, it is suggested, may 
                indicate a prolonged life time use of documents. For CiTO to serve the purpose of promoting knowledge export, 
                it should be more specific about citation functions, separating them from evaluation, and then be put to test as a discovery tool.</p>

            <h1>Introduction: the relevance of citation functions</h1>
            <p>Citations can often be seen as observable results of a transfer of knowledge, as records of used information.
                Citations as a potential measure of relevance was noted at least implicitly by
                <em>Gilbert</em> <a href="#gilbert-1977"> </a>:116. However, 
                the use of citations vary greatly. We focus here in particular on cross-disciplinary citations and the
                different functions they fulfil. What purpose do they serve? We want to know how the cited information is 
                used in the citing context, fully aware that there may
                be other reasons behind citations than strictly intra-scientific judgments of
                relevance, e.g. as a purely rhetorical device <a href="#gilbert-1977"> </a> <a href="#moed-2005"> </a>. 
                The references ultimately appearing in an article may also be determined by
                factors outside the author's immediate control, such as peer review and journal policies.</p>
            <p>Still, why is it that certain documents are being found relevant for the most various
                purposes over and over again long time after their publication, while others tend to
                fall into oblivion only a few years after their appearance. Which factors are
                involved in distinguishing the potentially long-lived cited document from the less
                successful, more short-lived ones? <em>Van Raan</em> and more recently <em>Ke et al.</em> 
                studied so called <q>sleeping beauties</q> in science, i.e. instances of <q>a publication that goes unnoticed (&#x91;sleeps&#x92;) for a long time
                    and then, almost suddenly, attracts a lot of attention (&#x91;is awakened by a prince&#x92;).</q> <a href="#vanRaan-2004"> </a> 
                Studying long 'sleeping beauties' (SBs) for the purpose of identifying cross-disciplinary citation functions promises to be rewarding,
                since <q>top SBs achieve delayed exceptional importance in disciplines different from those where they were originally published.</q> <a href="#ke-2015"> </a>
                <em>Levitt and Thelwall</em> <a href="#levitt-2009"> </a> found a link between multi-disciplinarity and a high citedness rate. 
                However, their study did not address the question of cross-disciplinary knowledge export. Multi-disciplinarity and even more so 
                interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity have more to do with the
                  <em>integration</em> or <em>synthesis</em> of scientific disciplines working on
                a common research project, as in the emerging so called I2S, Integration and
                Implementation Sciences <a href="#bammer-2015"> </a>:322. Cross-disciplinarity, on
                the other hand, is more about researchers in one scientific discipline seeking to
                apply new methodologies, solutions or problems taken from another, sometimes very
                distant discipline. Thus, results from studies of interdisciplinarity,
                transdisciplinarity or multi-disciplinarity cannot automatically be applied to cases
                of cross-disciplinary knowledge export. By knowledge export we understand here the
                transfer of knowledge from one discipline to another as documented by cross-disciplinary
                citations.</p>

            <p>Apart from the phenomenon of sleeping beauties, citation analyses have 
                shown substantial variations in citation patterns over time from one discipline to another. 
                There are indications e.g. that documents within the social sciences continue to be cited for a
                longer period of time than what is the case for the natural sciences <a href="#garfield-1979"> </a>. However, there are also examples of remarkably long-lived 
                documents from the natural sciences. 
                A classic paper by <em>Albert Einstein</em> from 1906 was still being cited in journal articles
                within fields so diverse as dairy sciences, pharmacology,
                physiology, ceramics, water pollution, acoustics, fluid mechanics,
                sedimentary petrology and molecular biology during the 1960s <a href="#garfield-1979"> </a>, and well into this
                 century again within ceramics, mechanics and sedimentology.</p>
            <p>Another example is that of <em>Molina and Rowland</em>
                <a href="#molina-1974"> </a>, a paper from the field of atmospheric
                chemistry published in 1974, which has continually been cited at least up until 
                the mid 1990s also within disciplines such as computer science, law, management,
                ophthalmology, optics, political science, pharmacology, sociology, 
                and, even more recently, risk management and medicine. 
                Noteworthy in cases like these, where papers continue to be used and cited over a long period of
                time, is precisely the subject dispersion of citing papers. 
                In the case of <a href="#molina-1974"> </a>, the fact that the paper 
                was published in a prestigious multi-disciplinary scientific journal like <em>Nature</em> 
                most likely promoted its exposure also to scientists from outside atmospheric chemistry.
                The attention it received was no doubt renewed in 1995 when the authors, together
                with Paul Crutzen, were awarded the Nobel prize <q>for their work in atmospheric
                chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone</q>.</p> 
            <p>Still, most articles published in <em>Nature</em> never come near the very high
                citation score attained by this paper. Moreover, <a href="#molina-1974"> </a> 
                received most citations years after its publication, not while it was
                still new and <q>outsiders</q>, with a fresh issue of Nature in hand, were more likely to
                be <q>accidentally</q> exposed to the paper, but still before the Nobel prize award
                (although admittedly there was a new peak in its citation count in
                1995, still lower though than in the top year 1976).</p>
            <p>Understanding the multipurposeness of scientific papers and their potential for
                knowledge export calls for an explanation of the function that the cited source
                fulfils in the context of the citing documents. How does the cited information fit into
                this sometimes completely new disciplinary environment? In this paper
                we examine a few examples of cross-disciplinary citation functions, to see if they could also 
                be expressed by the emerging standard citation typing ontology <em>CiTO</em>
                <a href="#shotton-2015"> </a> for the purpose of promoting knowledge export.</p>

        <section id="sec_CCA_and_citationfunctions">
            <h1>Content-based citation analysis and citation functions</h1>
            
            <p>Most citation analysis studies so far have been quantitative. Citation counts
                have been made, e.g, in order to identify the core literature of a
                scientific discipline and co-citation clustering has been used for mapping the
                structure of scientific disciplines <a href="#garfield-1979"> </a>. 
                <em>Lipetz</em>, pioneer of <em>qualitative</em> citation analysis, 
                investigated the relationship between cited reference and citing document, aiming to improve
                the selectivity of citation indexes, but the 29
                categories he proposed were obviously not intended to constitute a final judgment on
                the matter <a href="#lipetz-1965"> </a>.</p>
           
             <p>Since then qualitative or <em>content-based citation analysis</em> <a href="#ding-2014"> </a> 
                studies have produced a multitude of different schemes describing the various functions of
                citations, with considerable overlap between categories, although the exact labels
                used for classification differ among authors <a href="#liu-1993"> </a>. </p>
            <p>The earlier classification schemes for citation functions relied essentially on manual 
                citation analysis of relatively small sets of
                articles (typically 10 to 100 items), while later attempts have been made to use
                semi-automated or computational methods for citation classification of larger samples
                of full-text articles. An overview of these attempts is found in <em>Ding et al.</em>
                <a href="#ding-2014"> </a>.</p>

            <p>However, automated methods for citation classification, relying 
                on explicit signals or cue words for identification of citation functions 
                <a href="#teufel-2006a"> </a>, may not capture more complex cross-disciplinary citation relationships of the syntagmatic kind
                described by <em>Green and Bean</em> <a href="#green-1995"> </a>, where the relevance of the cited source to the
                citing document stems rather from the provision of a missing piece of information
                serving e.g. as part of an evidence chain. An example of this kind of
                relationship is given in the next section where we will be 
                looking closer at some cross-disciplinary citations apparently
                representing instances of knowledge export. Thus, this paper still depends on a small number 
                of manually extracted citations from a limited set of articles. The purpose is simply 
                to understand why a scientific article was found useful also outside its original field of research.
                What follows are some selected examples of citations of papers from the field of atmospheric
                chemistry or stratospheric ozone monitoring <a href="#philipson-1996"> </a>, all
                introduced by a description of the identified citation function
                followed by an analysis and discussion of a possible application of CiTO object
                properties.</p>

            <h1>Cross-disciplinary citation functions</h1>

              <p><strong>Comparison</strong>: Citation refers to similar results from another field of research.
                It may appear as a metaphorical type of relation, in which <q>one complex unit is
                    perceived as being structurally equivalent (as a whole or in part) to
                    another</q> <a href="#green-1995"> </a>:660. The importance of analogical, structural
                comparison (of similar or dissimilar elements) for knowledge transfer has been
                extensively described by <em>Day and Goldstone</em>
                <a href="#day-2012"> </a>. So it seems only natural that it figures in cases of
                cross-disciplinary knowledge export and use of scientific data another field of 
                research. A possible instance of this type is <a href="#mastenbrook-1983"> </a>:</p>
            <blockquote><p>
                <q>Similar long-term trends are to be found in total column ozone measurements.... 
                    London and Kelley (1974) examining global total ozone found an increase in both 
                    the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere during the 1960s.</q>
            </p></blockquote>
                       
            <p>This article had at the time of access no shared subject descriptors with the cited document 
            <a href="#london-1974"> </a> in two different research databases 
          (<a href="http://media2.proquest.com/documents/pq_advanced_tech_aerospace_prof_prosheet.pdf">Aerospace database</a>, 
                accessed March, 1996, and the <a href="http://media2.proquest.com/documents/pascal.pdf">Pascal database</a>,
                using exclusively English descriptors.) Thus, this is not a case of <em>topic matching</em>. 
                However, the citation link between <a href="#mastenbrook-1983"> </a> and
                <a href="#london-1974"> </a> appears to be rather strong, with the citation
                providing both <em>measurement data</em>, functioning as an item of
                    <em>comparison</em> and lending supporting <em>evidence</em> together with other
                cited documents to the conclusion that</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><q>the long-term trend in stratospheric water and its similarity to the long-term
                    trend in stratospheric ozone suggest that these changes arise from long-term
                    changes in the intensity of the circulation.</q> <a href="#mastenbrook-1983"> </a>:2164 </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>But obviously, the article is not <em>about</em> stratospheric ozone variation, which
                is the topic of <a href="#london-1974"> </a>. The main topic of <a href="#mastenbrook-1983"> </a> is described 
                by the title: <em>Stratospheric water vapor variability for Washington, DC/ Boulder,
                    CO: 1964-82</em>. Citations for this type of <q>non-topical</q> comparisons seem
                difficult to represent by means of CiTO. A possible candidate for a suitable CiTO
                object property in this case would perhaps be 
                <a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito#http://purl.org/spar/cito/extends"><em>cito:extends</em></a>
                <a about="#mastenbrook-1983" rel="cito:extends" href="#london-1974"> </a>, but it
                does not capture accurately the <q>non-topical</q> quality of this instance.</p>

            <p><strong>Evidence</strong>: Citation is used for support of propositions in citing entity. 
                Instances of conclusive, logically binding proofs may be rare; 
                rather, reference is often to the apparent agreement 
                between measurement data and predictions of a theory or a model. 
                This type of citation might seem more natural for
                specialists within a narrower field of research, as it may sometimes require
                expertise in the field to seize the arguments involved. However, there are also
                clear examples of cross-disciplinary citations for evidence. 
                Consider the following extract from an article published in a botanical journal 
                as an illustration:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><q>Good estimates of the present stratospheric distribution of ozone and subsequent
                    UV radiation are known (Koller, 1952; Dütsch, 1969; Cutchis, 1974). The total
                    amount of ozone in the northern hemisphere is maximal in spring and minimal in
                    fall. ... It is suggested that among flowering plants of the northern
                    hemisphere, many of which have white or yellow flowers (Table 2), there has been
                    convergent evolution in floral UV absorption. Yellow and white flowers are high
                    in flavonoid pigments which strongly absorb UV light. The seasonality of UV
                    radiation may be one major selective pressure. Yellow and white flowers comprise
                    as much as 85% of an arctic flora (Kevan, 1972).</q><a href="#utech-1975"> </a>:26f</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p> Discerning some of the more important of premisses involved in the inference leading to the 
                hypothesis in the third sentence of the extract, there is first
                the observation of the seasonal variation of stratospheric ozone and the subsequent
                seasonal variation of ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth, leading to a spring
                maximum of stratospheric ozone and a subsequent spring minimum of UV-radiation in
                the northern hemisphere (since stratospheric ozone absorbs UV-radiation). 
                Then there is the knowledge that yellow and white flowers are strong absorbants of
                UV-radiation. Finally there is the evidence of the predominance of yellow and white
                flowers in the northern hemisphere. Together these premisses make probable the
                hypothesis that UV-absorption ability has acted as a selective evolutionary
                mechanism for flowers in the northern hemisphere. It is important to note here that
                the different premisses come from different subject areas. The first three cited
                sources in the extract belong to geophysics or climatology, whereas <em>(Table 2)</em> and <em>(Kevan, 1972)</em>
                are from botany. Despite the differences in subject, the premisses apparently
                    <q>fit</q> together, as <q>slots in a framework</q> <a href="#green-1995"> </a>:660. 
                One describes certain environmental conditions. Another describes an important property of the
                object being studied, influencing its adaptation to the conditions described by the
                first. The third premiss describes the frequency of occurrence of the
                object being studied, thereby corroborating the importance of the property described
                by the second premiss. Together they make up an evidential structure, that accounts 
                for the relevance of the cited entities to the purpose of the citing document. 
                Thus, all the cited entities here could apparently be ascribed the CiTO object property <a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito#http://purl.org/spar/cito/isCitedAsEvidenceBy"><em>cito:isCitedAsEvidenceBy</em></a> <a href="#utech-1975"> </a>. Alternatively, some of these citations, e.g. those of
                the strictly botanical sources, might also be described by the CiTO property <a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito#http://purl.org/spar/cito/isCitedAsDataSourceBy">
                    <em>cito:isCitedAsDataSourceBy</em></a>
                <a href="#utech-1975"> </a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Force</strong>: Citation refers to a likely
                    <em>structure</em>, <em>mechanism</em> or <em>cause</em> behind observed
                phenomena. A typical example is a reference to a chemical reaction described by the cited entity. 
                Again this type of citation function would seem to be essentially an internal affair 
                among specialists within a field of research, but examples of <q>outsiders</q> 
                making use of it also occur, as this excerpt from a medical journal illustrates:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><q>Stratospheric ozone depletion, accompanied by increases in ambient, biologically
                    destructive ultraviolet-B radiation,<sup>104</sup> may exacerbate the effect of
                    climate change on infectious diseases. Arising from a different anthropogenic
                    process than climate change, ozone destruction is occurring primarily from
                    reactions between ozone and halogen free radicals derived from
                    chlorofluorocarbons, other halocarbons, and methyl bromide.</q><sup>105</sup>
                    <a href="#patz-1996"> </a> ; ref. (105) is to <a href="#molina-1974"> </a></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>No specific object property was found in CiTO for citations referring to
                a likely cause, mechanism or explanatory force. A significant difference between 
                the <em>evidence</em> and the <em>force</em> citation functions appeared in <a href="#philipson-1996"> </a>, 
                where the 32 citations of <a href="#molina-1974"> </a> for <em>evidence</em> had a median
                publishing year of 1975, only one year after the cited source, whereas the 26
                citations of the <em>force</em> type appeared to be among the most
                <q>long-lived</q>, in the sample, with a median publishing year of 1984, ten years
                after the cited source. The sample in that study was too small to allow any
                definite conclusions, but the apparent difference in age distribution may not be surprising
                anyway. The reference to an explanatory force in the form of a chemical reaction or
                structure should be of such permanence that it can be expected to be found not only
                in articles in scientific journals, but even in textbooks.</p>

            <p><strong>Method</strong>: Citation refers to the method employed in the cited work.
                This does not necessarily mean that the same method is used or even advocated by
                the citing article, as observed in the following example:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><q>Total ozone data were previously analyzed by a number of authors including Angell
                    and Korshover (1973), London and Kelly [sic!] (1974) with particular interest in
                    quantifying long-term trends. The statistical procedure commonly used in these
                    studies is linear regression analysis (i.e. fitting a straight line) applied to
                    adjusted total ozone values (e.g. deviations from monthly means ...). However,
                    problems arise in the interpretation of results from these linear regression
                    models since these models fail to take account of the positive autocorrelation
                    that is present in the ozone data. Hence, we consider time series analysis that
                    accounts for autocorrelation in a quantitative trend assessment of ozone data.</q><a href="#tiao-1983"> </a>:460)</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>In CiTO, the object property relating to method presupposes that the cited method is
                actually used by the citing document, 
                <a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito#http://purl.org/spar/cito/usesMethodIn">
                    <em>cito:usesMethodIn</em></a>. This is a problematic feature of CiTO; while some
                properties seem to be too general to distinguish between different specific citation
                functions, other properties, like this one, presuppose
                an active use or endorsement of the function expressed cited entity. There are of course a
                number of other object properties in CiTO expressing a negative evaluation of the
                cited entity, but these are again more general and hold no information about which
                function or part of the cited entity that is negatively evaluated. The
                methodological citations in the aforementioned study <a href="#philipson-1996"> </a>
                were few in number, but their relatively <q>long life</q> might be more than just 
                an accidental effect of the selection. If so, support
                could be gained from the results of <a href="#small-1977"> </a>, showing 
                how a scientific paper that was formerly frequently cited
                for <q>theoretical</q> reasons as describing the structure of collagen suddenly ceased
                to be among the highly cited papers for a short time, when
                the focus of research in the field shifted from structural studies to biosynthesis,
                only to reappear as one of the high ranking cited sources a year later, but then
                cited rather for its methodology <a href="#garfield-1979"> </a>:127f.</p>
           
            <p><strong>Result</strong>: Citation involves an implication, viz. <q><em>if</em>
                    information C<sub>0</sub> contained in cited document is true, and if
                    furthermore conditions C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, ... C<sub>n</sub> hold
                    good, <em>then</em> the consequences will be such and such</q>. Hence, the
                citing article does not necessarily have to endorse a claim of truth for the cited
                information; the only claim is for the potential <em>result</em>, given the
                conditions described by the antecedent of the implication. The auxiliary conditions
                    C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, ... C<sub>n</sub> furthermore do not have to be
                topically related to the cited information. The only requirement 
                is that there must be no contradiction among them.
                In <a href="#philipson-1996"> </a> several instances of this type of citation
                appeared in articles from journals, that were clearly peripheral to
                the field of research concerned with stratospheric ozone monitoring,
                coming from such disciplines as molecular biology, botany, or ophthalmology. 
                Researchers from <q>outside</q> naturally should be more concerned with 
                the implications of the cited information for their own field of research, rather than with trying to assess the
                validity of that information, lacking the necessary specialist competence for that. 
                The following passage may serve as an example:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><q>Recent studies by Cicerone (4) and <em>Molina and Rowland</em> (7) state that
                    increased use of fluorocarbons in aerosols and refrigerants could severely
                    deplete the protective layer of ozone in the stratosphere. This would increase
                    the level of UV-B radiation reaching the earth's surface. ...
                    The object of this study was to determine the effects of UV-B
                    irradiation on local lesion development of Chenopodium quinoa Willd. 'Valdivia'
                    plants inoculated with potato virus S (PVS).</q>(<em>Semeniuk and Goth</em>
                    <a href="#semeniuk-1980"> </a>; ref. (7) is to <a href="#molina-1974"> </a>)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Cito has an object property <a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito#http://purl.org/spar/cito/usesConclusionsFrom"><em>cito:usesConclusionsFrom</em></a> 
                that might fit for this kind of citation function, but again it seems the CiTO object property presupposes an active claim of truth for
                the cited information, whereas the <strong>result</strong> function described here is more neutral and conditional. 
                In general it would be preferable to separate citation functions from evaluative judgement as clearly as possible, 
                so that each citation function identified could be given one of three values, positive (+), negative (-) or neutral (0).</p>
            
            <p>Now, as we  have seen, not all the above examples of citation functions are directly translatable
                into CiTO object properties, but they nevertheless shed some light on the use of
                scientific information outside the discipline whence it originated. Possibly other, 
                even more compelling examples such as these can be found, where the age distance between cited and citing documents is larger, 
                as we already saw in section 1 for <em>Einstein (1906)</em> and <a href="#molina-1974"> </a>.

            <h1>Conclusions: indexing for knowledge export - can CiTO do the trick?</h1>

            <p>Could citation indexing with <em>CiTO</em>
                <a href="#shotton-2015"> </a> serve the purpose of <q>knowledge export</q>? 
                From the examples above it appears CiTO is not specific enough to capture 
                the finer differences between citation functions. At the
                same time there seems to be some redundancy in the present version of
                CiTO <a href="#ciancarini-2014"> </a>, so having index terms more
                more accurately describe citation functions while separating them from value judgments, does not
                necessarily imply that the number of object properties would have to grow
                substantially.</p>

            <p>We have seen some instances of cross-disciplinary citations characterized by the kind of 
                <em>hierarchical</em> or <em>structural</em>, <em>syntagmatic</em> relationships between citing and cited source, 
               described by <em>Green and Bean</em> <a href="#green-1995"> </a>. 
                With the citing entity representing the user need, 
                 <q>the topic of the user need and the topic of the cited passage are related as class and
                    subclass, or... as class and class-member</q> <a href="#green-1995"> </a>:659. This kind of <q>type-token</q> relationship can be expressed in
                citations by the provision of an instance of the class referred
                to. It may also appear in the form of the citation function referred to above as
                <em>comparison </em> with a structurally equivalent unit.</p>

            <p>Structural (or <em>syntagmatic</em>) relationships are those where <q>the topic of
                    the cited passage corresponds to a component within a conceptual syntagmatic
                    structure (...), while the topic of the user need corresponds to another
                    component within the structure, or again, the structure at large</q> <a href="#green-1995"> </a>:660. We saw an example of this relationship 
                    in the <em>evidence</em> function in the case of <a href="#utech-1975"> </a> above.</p>

            <p>The limited importance of topic matching relationships in citations was confirmed in
                a study by <em>Harter et al.</em> <a href="#harter-1993"> </a> from the area of 
                library and information science, in which the subject similarity among pairs of 
                cited and citing documents was found to be very small. However,
                independence from topic matching may vary between disciplines.
               <em>Guerrero-Bote et al.</em> found a significant correlation
                between the knowledge export and import rates of different subject categories: 
                <q>This indicates that there are Subject Categories which are more independent, importing and
                    exporting little knowledge, and others with greater flows of knowledge across
                    subject boundaries.</q> <a href="#guerrero-2007"> </a>:440</p>
                    

            <p>Indexing citation functions is not so much about representing <q>mental models</q> or capturing the original 
                <q>intention</q> of the citing author <a href="#ciancarini-2014"> </a> <a href="#teufel-2006a"> </a>, 
                but rather about describing the actual and potential <em>use</em> - past, present and future - of
                document contents. It is essential then to look at both sides of citation relationship simultaneously, 
                the <em>citing</em> entity and the <em>cited</em> source. A combination of citation functions 
                 and subject headings, extracted from both citing and cited entities might
                 offer even better prospects for knowledge export and provide researchers and readers with new context, 
                 adding new relevance to old documents, opening new opportunities for <q>evidence mining</q>. 
                 What is needed is a proper test of the capability of an indexing system of citation functions like CiTO, possibly revised and 
                 revamped, to serve as a <em>discovery tool</em> across scientific disciplines. Preparation for such a test could perhaps start 
                by indexing a sample of outside 'princes', who have awakened some of those long 'sleeping beauties', and then have a panel
                of independent researchers, unknowing of her history, find their way to <q>la Belle au bois dormant</q>.</p>
           

            <p>
                The resulting indexing scheme of a conclusive test should be sufficiently easy to use, 
                so that virtually anyone who reads and writes and cites would be able to contribute to the indexing effort.
                Online publishers of scientific journals, managers of digital repositories like
                JSTOR and existing citation indexes like  the Web of Science
                and CiteSeerX could make it happen by means of crowd-sourcing from the users.
                Ideally, tagging a scientific article online with citation functions from a
                controlled index language should be just little more complicated than liking a
                post on social media.</p>
