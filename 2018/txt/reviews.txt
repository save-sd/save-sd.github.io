The submitted papers will be publicly posted on the SAVE-SD 2018 web site upon submission. The authors will be known to reviewers (i.e., submissions are NOT anonymous).
SAVE-SD 2018 will encourage reviewers to sign their reviewers. However, reviewers can decide not to sign them, and thus the review will be anonymous. The reviews will be made publicly available on the SAVE-SD 2018 website in CC-BY upon final notification, including reviewer identity if they had signed the reviews. On explicit request made by the authors, the rejected papers and/or their reviews will be removed from the SAVE-SD 2018 website.

In order to evaluate the submitted papers, we have three different [programme committees (PCs)](organisation.html), i.e.:
- the *Senior PC*, whose members will act as meta-reviewers and have the crucial role of balancing the scores provided by the reviews from the other two PCs (see below);
- the *Industrial PC*, who will evaluate the submissions from an industrial perspective mainly – by assessing how much the theories/applications described in the papers do/may influence (positively or negatively) the publishing domain and whether they could be concretely adopted by publishers and scholarly data providers;
- the *Academic PC*, who will evaluate the papers from an academic perspective mainly – by assessing the quality of the research described in such papers.

All submissions will be reviewed (at least) by one Senior PC member, one Industrial PC member and two Academic PC members. The final decision of acceptance/rejection will be made in consensus by the chairs.
