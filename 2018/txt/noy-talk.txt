**Facilitative Discovery of Scientific Data**

The world generates reams of structured data every day: the data that we allow companies to collect about our everyday lives, the data that engineers produce as they analyze this collected data, the data that scientists collect to verify their next hypothesis, just to name a few examples. This data comes in many forms, formats, and sizes. Often, we want to find and, maybe, reuse the data that others have produced. Search companies today do a good job of organizing and searching unstructured data, such as HTML pages. However, organizing, understanding, searching, and reusing heterogeneous structured data is largely an open research problem. How do we collect the metadata and understand and capture the semantics of the data? How do we index and rank the datasets in search results? How do we encourage data publishers to provide semantically rich metadata? I will discuss the work that we do at Google to facilitate discovery of metadata on the Web, the challenges that we face, and our plans to contribute to the creation of a vibrant and open eco-system of data publishing.
