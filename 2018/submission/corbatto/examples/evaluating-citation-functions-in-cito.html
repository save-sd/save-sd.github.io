      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>Networks of citations are a key tool for referencing, disseminating and evaluating research
        results. The task of characterising the functional role of citations in scientific
        literature is very difficult, not only for software agents but for humans, too. The main
        problem is that the mental models of different annotators hardly ever converge to a single
        shared opinion. The goal of this paper is to investigate how an existing reference model for
        classifying citations, namely <em>CiTO</em> (<em>Citation Typing Ontology</em>), is interpreted
        and used by annotators of scientific literature. We present some experiments capturing the
        cognitive processes behind users' decisions in annotating papers with CITO, and provide
        initial ideas to refine future releases of CiTO and to simulate readers' behaviour within
        CiTaLO, a tool for automatic classification of citations. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The interest in alternative ways for publishing scientific results is rapidly increasing,
        especially for the Semantic Web community that is producing a lot of scientific data as
        Linked datasets which can be browsed and reasoned on <a href="#ZhuCitations"> </a><a href="#LinkedScience13Kauppinen"> </a><a href="#LinkedScience12Gil"> </a>. On the other hand, most of the current scientific
        production is still disseminated by “traditional” papers, and citations remain the key
          <em>tools</em> to connect, explore and evaluate research works.</p>
      <p>Citations are not all equal, as discussed by <a href="#ZhuCitations"> </a>. The
        frequency a work is cited is a partial indicator of its relevance for a community. More
        effective results can be obtained by looking for the <em>citation functions</em>, i.e. “the
        author's reasons for citing a given paper” <a href="#TeufelAnnotationScheme"> </a>. Yet, it is extremely difficult to characterise the nature of a citation univocally. </p>
      <p>A fairly successful classification model is <em>CiTO</em> (<em>Citation Typing Ontology</em>)<a href="#ftn6"> </a>
        <a href="#PeroniCiTOFaBiO"> </a>, an OWL ontology for describing factual as well
        as rhetorical functions of citations in scientific articles and other scholarly works. CiTO
        defines forty-one properties that allow users to characterise precisely the semantics of a
        citation act. CiTO has been successfully used in large projects like <em>CiteULike</em><a href="#ftn7"> </a> and <em>Data.open.ac.uk</em><a href="#ftn8"> </a> and several tools have been developed to annotate citations with CiTO
        properties directly via browser<a href="#ftn9"> </a> or CMS plugins<a href="#ftn10"> </a>.</p>
      <p>Despite (or possibly because of) the richness and variety of CiTO properties, most users
        actually employ a sub-set of these properties: a smaller set of properties is easier to
        memorise and handle, some properties are not perceived as precise in specific domains, some
        others are considered too similar to each others, and so on. For instance, Pensoft
          Publishers<a href="#ftn11"> </a> (to our knowledge, the first commercial
        user of CiTO) are going to enable authors to annotate their citations according to six CiTO
        properties only. The <em>Link to Link Wordpress </em>plugin supports about ten properties.</p>
      <p>Clearly some work restructuring the ontology is in order. This paper in fact presents an
        experimental analysis on how the CiTO model is accepted, understood, and adopted by users.
        It discusses tests performed in parallel both on the full set of CiTO properties and on a
        specific subset, along with the feedback directly provided by the users. The goal is to
        validate and assess the usability of CiTO and to distill guidelines for a more effective use
        of the current ontology and for improvements to the future releases. Also, we want to study
        user behaviour in order to simulate it within CiTalO<a href="#ftn12"> </a>
        <a href="#CiTalO"> </a>, a chain of tools for identifying automatically the
        nature of citations.</p>
      <p>The most critical aspect identified by our tests is that opinions about the most
        appropriate CiTO properties are often misaligned. Apparently each reader relies on a
        different <em>mental model</em>, and the reader's model can be and often is different from the
        one of the authors of the CiTO annotation, which in turn can be and often is different from
        the one of the authors of the citation in the paper.</p>
      <p>This paper is structured as follows: in <a href="#SectionRelatedWorks"> </a> we
        review previous works on classification of citations. In <a href="#SectionCiTO"> </a> we present CiTO and relate it with users' mental models. In <a href="#SectionTest"> </a> we introduce our experimental setting and findings. In <a href="#SectionDiscussion"> </a> and <a href="#SectionConclusions"> </a> we discuss the lesson learnt and sketch out some possible developments of CiTO and
        CiTalO.</p>

      <p>The analysis of networks of citations is gaining more and more attention. Copestake <em>et
          al. </em><a href="#CopestakeScientificText"> </a> present an infrastructure,
        called SciBorg, based on NLP techniques that allows one to automatically extract semantic
        characterisations of scientific texts. In particular, they developed a module for discourse
        and citation analysis based on the approach proposed by Teufel <em>et al.</em>
        <a href="#TeufelArgumentationZone"> </a> called <em>Argumentative Zoning</em>
          (<em>AZ</em>). AZ provides a procedural mechanism to annotate sentences of an article
        according to one out of seven classes of a given annotation scheme (i.e. <em>background</em>,
          <em>own</em>, <em>aim</em>, <em>textual</em>, <em>contrast</em>, <em>basis</em> and <em>other</em>),
        thus interpreting the intended authors' motivation behind scientific content and
        citations.</p>
      <p>Teufel <em>et al. </em><a href="#TeufelAutomaticClassification"> </a>
        <a href="#TeufelAnnotationScheme"> </a> study the <em>function</em> of citations –
        that they define as “author's reason for citing a given paper” – and provide a
        categorisation of possible citation functions organised in twelve classes, in turn clustered
        in <em>Negative</em>, <em>Neutral</em> and <em>Positive</em> rhetorical functions. In addition,
        they performed some tests involving hundreds of articles in computational linguistics
        (stored as XML files), several human annotators and a machine learning approach for the
        automatic annotation of citation functions. The results were quite promising; however the
        agreement between human annotators (i.e. K = 0.72) is still higher than the one between the
        human annotators and the machine learning approach (i.e. K = 0.57).</p>
      <p>Jorg <a href="#JorgNatureCitations"> </a> analysed the ACL Anthology Networks<a href="#ftn13"> </a> and found one hundred fifty <em>cue verbs</em>, i.e.
        verbs usually used to carry important information about the nature of citations: <em>based
          </em><em>on</em>, <em>outperform</em>, <em>focus on</em>, <em>extend</em>, etc. She maps cue verbs
        to classes of citation functions according to the classification provided by Moravcsik <em>et
          al.</em>
        <a href="#MoravcsikFunctionCitation"> </a> and makes the bases to the development
        of a formal citation ontology. This works actually represent one of the sources of
        inspiration of <em>CiTO</em> (the <em>Citation Typing Ontology</em>) developed by Peroni <em>et
          al. </em><a href="#PeroniCiTOFaBiO"> </a>, which is an ontology that permits the
        motivations of an author when referring to another document to be captured and described by
        using Semantic Web technologies such as RDF and OWL.</p>
      <p>Closely related to the annotation of citation functions, Athar <a href="#AtharSentimentAnalysis"> </a> proposes a sentiment-analysis approach to citations,
        so as to identify whether a particular act of citing was done with positive (e.g. praising a
        previous work on a certain topic) or negative intentions (e.g. criticising the results
        obtained through a particular method). Starting from empirical results Athar <em>et al.
          </em><a href="#AtharContextEnhanced"> </a> expand the above study and show how
        the correct sentiment (in particular, a negative sentiment) of a particular citation usually
        does not emerge from the citation sentence – i.e. the sentence that contains the actual
        pointer to the bibliographic reference of the cited paper. Rather, it actually becomes
        evident in the last part of the considered <em>context window</em><a href="#ftn14"> </a>
        <a href="#QazvinianNonExplicitCitingSentences"> </a>.</p>
      <p>Hou <em>et al.</em><a href="#HouCountingCitation"> </a> use an alternative
        approach to understand the relevance (seen as a form of positive connotation/sentiment) of
        citations: the citation counting in a text. Paraphrasing the authors, the idea is that the
        more a paper is cited within a text, the more its scientific contribution is
        significative.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="SectionCiTO">
      <h1>Users' adoption of CiTO</h1>
      <p>There are several reference models to characterise citations, as presented in the previous
        section. One of the most used within the Semantic Web domain is CiTO <a href="#PeroniCiTOFaBiO"> </a>. The ontology basically defines a property <em>cites</em> (and
        its inverse <em>isCitedBy</em>) and 41 sub-properties (each of which has its own inverse) that
        describe the semantics of a citation act.</p>
      <p>The richness of properties is a key feature of CiTO. To the best of our knowledge, there is
        no other OWL ontology that provides a set of properties for annotating citation types as
        rich as CiTO. This aspect has contributed to the adoption of the ontology by the Semantic
        Publishing <a href="#ShottonSemanticPublishing"> </a> community, which is
        currently exploiting CiTO in projects like <em>CiteULike</em>, <em>Data.open.ac.uk</em>, and the
          <em>Open Citation Corpus</em>
        <a href="#ShottonOpenCitations"> </a>.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the richness of CiTO is perceived as a hindrance by some annotators. We
        studied the actual adoption of the model within these projects and discovered that most
        tools actually employ a sub-set of the CiTO properties (CiTO-Ps on the rest of the text).
        For instance, Pensoft Publishers are going to enable authors to annotate their citations
        according to only six CiTO-Ps – i.e., <em>citesAsDataSource</em>, <em>related</em>,
          <em>critiques</em>, <em>supports</em>, <em>reviews</em> and <em>discusses</em> – while the <em>Link
          to Link Wordpress plugin</em> allows users to specify the generic function <em>cites</em> and
        some of its sub-properties: <em>citesAsSourceDocument</em>, <em>confirms</em>, <em>extends</em>,
          <em>obtainsBackgroundFrom</em>, <em>reviews</em>, <em>supports</em>, <em>usesDataFrom</em>,
          <em>usesMethodIn</em>, and <em>disagreesWith. </em></p>
      <p>We believe that one of the reasons for this fragmented adoption is that CiTO was developed
        with a <em>top-down</em> approach: the authors of the ontology, supported by a group of
        experts and end-users, and with the help of previous works on this topic, studied
        collections of scientific papers and citation patterns and came up with a set of properties
        that was incrementally refined.</p>
      <p>The goal of this work is to assess and validate the CiTO-Ps from a <em>bottom-up</em>
        perspective. This approach is complementary to the current CiTO development process and
        allows us to study how CiTO-Ps are actually perceived by users in the task of annotating
        citations. </p>
      <section>
        <h1>CiTO annotations and mental models</h1>
        <p>One of the most relevant issues we found is that multiple views coexist <strong>and often
            conflict</strong> when performing an annotation task with CiTO. We can see three steps in
          this process: (i) the interpretation of the text so as to guess the citation function as
          it was originally conceived by the author, (ii) the understanding of the CiTO-Ps and (iii)
          the creation of a mapping between the supposed function of a citation and the most
          appropriate CiTO property.</p>
        <p>For each step, each annotator creates her/his own <em>mental model</em>. Mental models were
          introduced in 1943 by Craik <a href="#Craik1943"> </a> as <em>small-scale
            models</em> of reality that the humans' mind uses to anticipate events. For most
          cognitive scientists today, a mental model is an internal scale-model representation of an
          external reality. It is built on-the-fly, from knowledge of prior experience, schema
          segments, perception, and problem-solving strategies. In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
          mental models are detected for improving the usability of a system. It is commonly
          accepted that humans interact with systems based on a set of beliefs<a href="#ftn15"> </a> about how a system works. </p>
        <p>This also applies to CiTO processes: users annotate a citation based on a set of beliefs
          that they obtain by only interpreting the citation's context and finding an appropriate
          property in CiTO according to their interpretation of the ontology. Our goal is to study
          these beliefs and the mental models built by the users. The work is based on the
          hypothesis that usability is tied strongly to the extent to which these models match and
          predicts the action of a system. The overall objective is to reduce the gap between the
          System Model, the mental model constructed by the ontology engineer while modelling
          CiTO-Ps, and the User Model, the mental model constructed by a user for understanding how
          to use CiTO-Ps.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="SectionTest">
      <h1>Experimental analysis of CiTO use </h1>
      <p>In order to assess how CiTO is used to annotate scholarly articles, we compared the
        classifications performed by humans on a set of citations. The tests involved twenty users
        with different background and skills. We meant to collect a set of quantitative indicators
        to answer the following numbered research questions (RQ<em>n</em>) on CiTO:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Which properties have been used by users during the test?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Which were the most used properties?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What was the global inter-rater agreement of the users?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Did the number of available choices bias the global inter-rater agreement?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Which properties showed an acceptable positive agreement in users?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Could properties be clustered according to their similarity in users' annotations?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What was the perceived usability of the ontology?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Which were the features of CiTO-Ps that users perceived as most useful or
            problematic?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Additionally, after the completion of the annotation task, we asked each user to fill two
        questionnaires: a multiple-choice questionnaire aimed at measuring the System Usability
        Scale (SUS) <a href="#BrookeSUS"> </a>, and a second questionnaire with free-text
        answers to capture the users' satisfaction in using CiTO-Ps for annotating citations.</p>
      <p>In order to simplify the task of annotating citations, we prepared and normalized how the
        citations were presented to the users. Identifying the boundaries of a citation, or better
        which boundaries are needed to capture the nature of that citation, is not a trivial task:
        the citation sentence, i.e. the sentence containing directly the citation, often is not
        enough. As confirmed by Athar <em>et al.</em>
        <a href="#AtharContextEnhanced"> </a>, the actual intended sentiment and
        motivation of a citation might be explicated in other sentences close to the citation and
        can refer implicitly (i.e. by means of <em>implicit citations </em><a href="#AtharImplicitCitations"> </a>) to the cited work (through authors' names, project's
        name, pronouns, etc.). This issue is known as the <em>identification of context window</em>
        <a href="#QazvinianNonExplicitCitingSentences"> </a>. Even if there are multiple
        techniques for automatic extraction of the context window, taking care also of implicit
        citations, in this experiment we identified them manually: we read the text and tried to
        understand which sequence of sentences around a particular citation conveyed its citation
        function at the best.</p>
      <section>
        <h1>Experimental setting</h1>
        <p>The test bed includes some scientific papers encoded in XML DocBook chosen among the
          seventh volume of the proceedings Balisage Conference Series<a href="#ftn16"> </a>. We automatically extracted citation sentences, through an XSLT
          transform (available at <code>http://www.essepuntato.it/2013/citalo/xslt</code>). We took into account only those
          papers for which the XSLT transform retrieved at least one citation (i.e. 18 papers
          written by different authors). The total number of citations retrieved was 377, for a mean
          of 20.94 citations per paper.</p>
        <p>We then filtered all the citation sentences that contain verbs (extends, discusses, etc.)
          and/or other grammatical structures (uses method in, uses data from, etc.) that carry
          explicitly a citation function. We considered that rule as a strict guideline as also
          suggested by Teufel <em>et al.</em><a href="#TeufelAutomaticClassification"> </a>. We obtained 105 citations out of 377, obtaining at least one citation for each of
          the 18 paper used (a mean of 5.83 citations per paper). These citations are very
          heterogeneous and provide us a significative sample for out tests. Finally, we manually
          expanded each citation sentence (i.e. the sentence containing the reference to a
          bibliographic entity) selecting a context window that we think is useful to classify that
          citation, as explained above.</p>
        <p>The test was carried on by two groups, each one composed by ten users, by means of a Web
            interface<a href="#ftn17"> </a>. The first group could select properties
          out of the full list of 41 CiTO-Ps (<em>T41</em> from now on). Instead, the second one
          performed the same task by only using 10 CiTO-Ps<a href="#ftn18"> </a>
            (<em>T10</em>). This reduced set of properties comes from a preliminary experiment we
          undertook in <a href="#AIC"> </a> that showed that only these properties had a
          moderate inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' <em>k </em>&gt; 0.33). The goal in fact is to answer
          RQ4: does the number of properties affect the inter-rater agreement? </p>
        <p>Both groups were composed mainly by computer scientists (the main area of the Balisage
          Conference), none an expert user of CiTO. Each user read each citation sentence
          separately, with its full context window, and had to select one CiTO-Ps for that sentence.
          Users could also revise their choices and perform the experiments off-line. There was no
          time constraint and users could freely access the CiTO documentation.</p>
        <p>All the data collected were stored in RDF and we used R<a href="#ftn19"> </a> to load the data and elaborate the results<a href="#ftn20"> </a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>The experiments confirmed some of our hypotheses and highlighted some unexpected issues
          too. The first point to notice is that our users have selected 37 different CiTO
          properties over 41 in T41, with an average of 21.7 properties per user, while they have
          selected all the 10 properties in T10 (the mean by user is 10) (RQ1). Moreover, in T41 a
          few of these properties have been used many times, while most of them have been selected
          in a small number of cases, as shown in <a href="#TableCitationFuctionsHumans"> </a> – this table answers to RQ2.</p>

        <h1>Data evaluation</h1>
        <p>Considering all the 105 citations, the agreement among humans was very poor in both T41
          and T10. In fact we measured the Fleiss' <em>k </em>(that assesses the reliability of
          agreement between a fixed number of raters classifying item) for the 10 raters over all
          105 subjects and obtained <em>k = </em>0.13 in T41 and <em>k</em> = 0.15 in T10, meaning that
          there exists a positive agreement between users but it is very low – this answers to RQ3.
          In addition, the use of a larger number of CiTO-Ps (in T41 compared to T10) does not seem
          to affect the inter-rater agreement among users (RQ4).</p>
        <p>Another very interesting finding is that users eventually agree only on one property per
          test. Even considering the whole dataset whose <em>k</em> value was very low, we found a
          moderate positive local agreement (i.e. 0.33 &lt; <em>k</em> &lt; 0.66) on
            <em>citesAsPotentialSolution</em> in T41 and on <em>includesQuotationFrom</em> in T10 – this
          answers to RQ5.</p>
        <p>In order to identify other properties that showed a partial positive local agreement
          among users, we filtered only the 18 (in T41) and 24 (in T10) citations on which at least
          6 users used the same property, as mentioned earlier in <a href="#TableAgreements"> </a>. The <em>k</em> value on that subset showed a moderate
          positive agreement: <em>k </em>= 0.39 in T41 and <em>k</em> = 0.43 in T10. In addition, we had
            <em>k</em> &gt; 0.5 for 5 CiTO-Ps in T41 – i.e., <em>agreesWith</em> (<em>k</em> = 0.54),
            <em>citesAsDataSource</em> (<em>k</em> = 0.52), <em>citesAsPotentialSolution</em> (<em>k</em> =
          0.66), <em>citesAsRecommendedReading</em> (<em>k</em> = 0.6), <em>usesMethodIn</em> (<em>k</em> =
          0.54) – and for 4 CiTO-Ps in T10 – <em>citesAsDataSource</em> (<em>k</em> = 0.63),
            <em>citesAsPotentialSolution</em> (<em>k</em> = 0.71), <em>citesAsRecommendedReading</em>
            (<em>k</em> = 0.52, <em>includesQuotationFrom</em> (<em>k</em> = 0.69).</p>
        <p>Given this heterogeneity, we tried to identify clusters of properties and to understand
          whether the testers selected the same properties together. The goal is to found which
          properties have similar meaning according to users' annotation. To do so, we applied the
          Chinese Whispers clustering algorithm <a href="#BiemannChineseWhispers"> </a>
          to the graphs of collocates obtained by looking at the annotations provided by each user
          for each citation in T41. The graphs were built as follows. For each citation, we
          considered all the combinations of pairs of different CiTO-Ps as annotated by users,
          considering repetitions in the graph <em>Gr</em> and without repetitions in the graph
            <em>Gn</em> – it means that, for instance, having three users' annotations of a citation –
          e.g., <em>extends</em>, <em>extends</em>, and <em>updates</em> – we generated two pairs in G1 –
          i.e., <em>(extends,updates)</em> and <em>(extends,updates)</em> – and one pair in G2 – i.e.,
            <em>(extends,updates)</em>. In fact we were interested in highlighting recurrent
          collocates when CiTO-Ps were used at local level (Gr) or at a global level (Gn). Then, we
          created an edge linking two nodes (i.e., two different CiTO-Ps) for each collocate and we
          weighted it according to how many times that collocate is repeated in the dataset. We run
          the Chinese Whisper algorithm for 20 iterations on each graph and we observed that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>in Gr, considering only those arcs having weight at least 3, the algorithm returned a
              small cluster composed by the CiTO-Ps <em>disputes</em>, <em>critics</em>, <em>derides</em>
              and <em>refutes</em>;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>in Gn, considering only those arcs having weight at least 5, the algorithm returned
              another small cluster composed by the CiTO-Ps <em>credits</em>, <em>confirms</em> and
                <em>obtainsSupportFrom</em>.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The algorithm results seem to indicate that there exist some sort of relations (e.g.,
          taxonomical, equivalence, etc.) among the CiTO-Ps of each cluster and, to some extent,
          they can be used in an interchangeable way when annotating the citations – this answer to
          RQ6.</p>

      <h1>Users' feedback: SUS and grounded analysis</h1>
      <p>At the end of the test, both groups of testers were asked to answer to a SUS questionnaire
        including some free-text answering fields – in order to get some feedback on CiTO. The
        usability score for CiTO-Ps was computed using the <em>System Usability Scale</em>
        (<em>SUS</em>) <a href="#BrookeSUS"> </a>, a well-known metrics used for the
        perception of the usability of a system. It has the advantage of being technology
        independent and it is reliable even with a very small sample size <a href="#SauroGuideSUS"> </a>. In addition to the main SUS scale, we also were interested in
        examining the sub-scales of pure <em>Usability</em> and pure <em>Learnability</em> of the
        system, as proposed recently by Lewis and Sauro <a href="#LewisSUS"> </a>. As
        shown in <a href="#TableEvaluation"> </a>, the mean SUS score for CiTO-Ps in T41
        was 53.5 while in T10 was 62.5 (in a 0 to 100 range). The mean values for the SUS sub-scales
        Usability and Learnability were, respectively, 50.94 and 63.7 in T41 and 60.94 and 68.7 in
        T10. However, the only difference approaching the statistical significance (i.e., 0.05 &lt;
        p &lt; 0.1) was found between the Usability measures (i.e., p = 0.06), suggesting that the
        perceived usability of CiTO-Ps in T10 is better than that of CiTO-Ps in T41 – this answer to
        RQ7.</p>

      <p>The final text questionnaire contained a few questions, two asking for positive aspects,
        and two for negative aspects of CITO, and orthogonally two asking for qualifications (i.e.,
        adjectives), and two for features (i.e., substantives) of the tool: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>How effectively did CiTO properties support you in answering to the previous tasks?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What were the most useful features (labels, descriptions, examples, etc.) of CiTO
            properties to help you realise your tasks?</p>
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A fifth question was added to propose a discussion about the sheer size of the list of CITO
        properties: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Considering the experiment you have just completed, do you think that the number of
            CiTO properties was:</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All 20 (10 in T41 and 10 in T10) subjects produced relevant content for the questions.</p>
      <p>In order to obtain some meaningful results, we subjected the text answers to a <em>grounded
          theory</em> analysis. Grounded theory <a href="#StraussCorbin"> </a> is a method
        often used in Social Science to extract relevant concepts from unstructured corpora of
        natural language resources (e.g., texts, interviews, or questionnaires). In opposition to
        traditional methods aiming at fitting (and sometimes forcing) the content of the resources
        into a prefabricated model, grounded theory aims at having the underlying model emerge
        “naturally” from the systematic collection, rephrasing, reorganisation and interpretations
        of the actual sentences and terms of the resources. We thus believe it is a reasonable tool
        to examine our questionnaires in order to let relevant concepts emerge from the analysis. </p>
      <p>We proceeded first with <em>open coding</em>, with the purpose of extracting actual relevant
        sentences – called <em>codes</em> – from the texts, and subsequently performed the so-called
          <em>axial coding</em>, which is the rephrasing of the original codes so as to have semantic
        connections emerge from them and generate concepts. We finally analysed the respective
        frequency of each emerged concept (defined as the number of codes which contributed to the
        concept's existence) so as to consider the most important issues arising from the
        answers.</p>
      <p>Coding was performed separately in T41 and T10, but a later effort to homogenise the
        concepts drawn from the two sets was performed, so that results from the two tests could be
        compared. <a href="#FigureGrounded"> </a> shows the results of those codes that
        were mentioned at least twice.</p>

      <p>Some interesting suggestions came up from these data – this answers to RQ8.</p>
      <p><strong>Need to improve labels.</strong> The first question basically asked to identify the best
        between property label, property description and example, in conveying the best use of the
        property. Users massively preferred examples, with descriptions in the middle and labels
        last. This clearly indicates that CiTO labels should be improved to capture the nuances in
        the semantics of the CITO-Ps. </p>
      <p><strong>Need for a structure in the properties.</strong> It was evident the perception that many
        properties, for good or worse, overlapped semantically, often forcing a choice between
        similar properties rather than offering a clear and natural candidate. The issue of the
        hierarchy was particularly felt by the T41 testers, working with a flat list of 41 items:
        nine people (i.e., all but one) complained about this fact and asked for structured
        guidance. Another difference between the two tests (probably obvious in hindsight), is that
        testers in T41 had issues with the sheer number of properties (six individuals discussed
        about this) and with a feeling of imbalance in how they addressed the semantic scope of the
        citations. This suggests that the structuring of the properties loudly asked by the testers
        should also consider an adequate balancing of the properties, without exaggerating with
        negative ones, with sentiment-loaded ones, or with relationships. </p>
      <p><strong>Need for uniformity and bi-directional properties.</strong> A final mention should be given,
        in our view, to specific ideas and suggestions that, although provided by one tester each,
        are nonetheless interesting and worth further exploration: making all properties
        bi-directional (so that we could have both “gives support to” and “receives support from”),
        providing a decision tree for properties (so as to simplify the task of choosing the right
        one), or helping with the use of statistics (e.g., 30% of citations are request for
        information, 6% are credits, etc.) which also could provide guidance, if not for the best
        candidate property, at least for uniformity in choices between different annotators.</p>

    <section id="SectionConclusions">
      <h1>Lessons learnt and conclusions</h1>
      <p>The starting point of this paper was that the characterisation of citations is an extremely
        difficult task also for humans. We presented some experiments to investigate which are the
        main difficulties behind this characterisation and, in particular, how the users understand
        and adopt CiTO based on the mental models they construct for addressing the annotations
        task. Our analysis – both experimental data and users' direct feedback – gave us some
        indications to improve CiTO and to increase its effectiveness, that we would summarise as
        follows.</p>
      <p><strong>Reduce the number of less-used properties.</strong> One of our findings was that some of the
        CiTO-Ps in T41 were used only few times or not used at all. This result can depend on a
        variety of factors. First, the authors of the articles in our dataset, which are researchers
        on markup languages, use a quite specific jargon so the context windows resulted not easy to
        interpret with respect to citations. Second, the positive or negative connotation of the
        properties was difficult to appreciate. For instance, the fact that the properties carrying
        negative judgements (<em>disagreesWith</em>, <em>disputes</em>, <em>parodies</em>,
          <em>plagiarizes</em>, <em>refutes</em>, <em>repliesTo</em>, <em>ridicules</em>, etc.) are less
        frequent than neutral and positive ones supports the findings of Teufel <em>et al.</em>
        <a href="#TeufelAutomaticClassification"> </a> on this topic. Notice also that,
        as highlighted by <a href="#HornseySugaring"> </a>, a criticism can be postponed
        far from the sentence containing the citation and can be prefaced with positive feedback;
        where ever the criticism occur, it can be “toned down, disguised, or redirected away from
        important people” <a href="#MacRobertsNegationalReference"> </a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Identify the most-used neutral properties.</strong> Although we think the intended audience
        of the research articles one choose for such an experiment may bias the use of some
        properties, we also believe that some properties are actually shared among different
        scholarly domains. The property <em>citesForInformation</em> and <em>citesAsRelated</em> are a
        clear example. As expected, they were the most used properties, being the most neutral ones
        of CiTO<em>.</em> This is in line with the findings of Teufel <em>et al.</em>
        <a href="#TeufelAnnotationScheme"> </a>, on the analysis of citations within
        Linguistics scholarly literature. In that paper, the neutral category <em>Neut</em> was used
        for the majority of annotations by humans. Although their large adoption,
          <em>citesForInformation</em> and <em>citesAsRelated</em> had a very low positive local
        agreement (<em>k </em>= 0.07 and <em>k</em> = 0.2 respectively). This is not surprising since
        the properties were used many times, often as neutral classification on citations that were
        classified in a more precise way by other users. Note that one particular user in T41
        identified <em>credits</em> as the most used (and, thus, neutral) property, which is also
        confirmed by running the Chinese Whispers algorithm on Gr, considering only those arcs
        having weight at least 5, that showed how <em>credits</em> formed a cluster of one element
        only and was linked to other more specific properties such as <em>citesAsAuthority</em>,
          <em>citesAsDataSource</em>, <em>discusses</em>, etc. </p>
      <p><strong>Investigate motivations for low inter-rater agreement.</strong> The main reason for running
        the two test T41 and T10 was to investigate whether the high number (i.e., 41) of CiTO-Ps
        could be a justification for obtaining a so low positive agreement in total (i.e., <em>k</em>
        = 0.13), due to the cognitive effort users spent to choose among such huge set of properties
        for annotating citations. Intuitively, a reduced number of properties should reduce the
        cognitive effort required by the users in building their mental models for understanding
        CiTO-Ps for annotating a given set of citations. Although the comparison of the SUS values
        obtained for T41 (which involved 41 CiTO-Ps) and T10 (where we asked to use only 10 CiTO-Ps)
        was in favour of the latter, i.e., the users perceived the small set of properties as more
        usable of the full set for annotating citations, the inter-rater agreements obtained in T41
        (i.e., <em>k</em> = 0.13) and T10 (i.e., <em>k</em> = 0.15) show how the number of available
        CiTO-Ps did not actually impact too much. We have also tried to consider the results
        obtained in the two test if only expert users of citations (i.e., professors, academic
        researchers, postdoc and last year PhD students, representing half of the users in each
        test) were involved, and we noticed that the inter-rater agreements do not change at all for
        both tests. It seems that the number of CiTO-Ps and the kinds of users are not the main
        factors to take into account for that low agreement.</p>
      <p><strong>Define explicit relations between CiTO properties.</strong> since there is no hierarchical
          structure<a href="#ftn21"> </a>, each user followed its own mapping
        determined by the mental model built and ended up selecting very different values – probably
        because users' mental models differed largely between users. Our opinion is that a further
        investigation is needed on the structure of CiTO properties. To this end, the identification
        of clusters of properties, such as those introduced in the previous section, could be a
        possible way to follow, as well as the use of other approaches, i.e., pure statistical
        techniques for assessing collocates of CiTO-Ps (e.g., the use of chi-square test to analyse
        bigrams of collocates <a href="#ManningNLP"> </a>) and empirical algorithms used
        for identifying relations (taxonomical, equivalence, meronomy, etc.) among keywords (e.g.,
        Klink <a href="#OsborneKlink"> </a>). These approaches could be useful, for
        instance, to suggest ways to separate general properties form more specific ones or to build
        one or multiple hierarchies over the list of properties.</p>
      <p><strong>Add support for customised properties.</strong> One of the aspects of CiTO that users
        suggested to improve is its support for customisation. In some cases users could not find a
        property that perfectly fit their needs: they selected the one apparently closest to their
        mental model but they perceived this as a limitation of the model. To solve this issue, the
        latest release of CiTO – supported by our findings – includes an extension mechanism that
        allow users to use their own citation function. The syntax is briefly shown below:</p>
      <pre><code> @prefix cito: &lt;http://purl.org/spar/cito/&gt; . @prefix oa:
        &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#&gt; . @prefix dcterms: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; . [] a
        oa:Annotation ; oa:hasBody [ dcterms:description "The cited paper initiated a whole field of
        research" ] ; oa:hasTarget [ a cito:CitationAct ; cito:hasCitingEntity
        &lt;uri-citing-paper&gt; ; cito:hasCitationEvent cito:cites ; cito:hasCitedEntity
        &lt;uri-cited-paper&gt; ] .</code></pre>
      <p>The interesting aspect is that the overall organisation of the ontology (i.e., the TBox)
        does not change, while users are free to express precisely their characterisation capturing
        details and tones.</p>
      <p><strong>Extend examples, labels and explanations.</strong> The fact that some properties were
        misunderstood by the users – or the same property interpreted in different ways – is an
        indicator of the need for improvements in examples shown in our tests. One possible way of
        improving them will be to use the citations with the highest agreement and create additional
        samples from them.</p>
      <p>These findings will also provide a basis for improving CiTalO <a href="#CiTalO"> </a>, a tool for identifying automatically the nature of citations. In particular, we plan
        to in our ongoing work to investigate cognitive architecture in order to extend CiTalO to
        simulate users' behaviour determined by mental models.</p>
