The proceedings of SAVE-SD will be collected in the Companion volume of the [WWW 2015 conference](http://www.www2015.it), which will be published by ACM in its digital library. The WWW 2015 organisers will require at least one registration per paper published in the Companion volume. At the time of submission of the final camera-ready copy, authors will have to indicate the already registered person for that publication.

In addition, the authors of the best papers of the workshop will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue that will be published as part of the [PeerJ Computer Science](https://peerj.com/computer-science/), a new open access journal in Computer Science published by the award winning open access publisher [PeerJ](https://peerj.com).
