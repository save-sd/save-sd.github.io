The main goal of this workshop is bringing together publishers, companies and researchers from different fields (among which Document and Knowledge Engineering, Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, Scholarly Communication, Bibliometrics, and Human-Computer Interaction) in order to bridge the gap between **the theoretical/academic and practical/industrial aspects** in regards to scholarly data. The following topics will be addressed:

- **semantics** of scholarly data, i.e. how to semantically represent, categorize, connect and integrate scholarly data, in order to foster reusability and knowledge sharing;
- **analytics** on scholarly data, i.e. designing and implementing novel and scalable algorithms for knowledge extraction with the aim of understanding research dynamics, forecasting research trends, fostering connections between groups of researchers, informing research policies, analysing and interlinking experiments and deriving new knowledge;
- **visualisation** of and **interaction** with scholarly data, i.e. providing novel user interfaces and applications for navigating and making sense of scholarly data and highlighting their patterns and peculiarities.
