In order to evaluate the submitted papers, we have three different [program committees (PCs)](organisation.html), i.e.:

- the *Senior PC*, whose members will act as meta-reviewers and have the crucial role of balancing the scores provided by the reviews from the other two PCs (see below);
- the *Industrial PC*, who will evaluate the submissions from an industrial perspective mainly – by assessing how much the theories/applications described in the papers do/may influence (positively or negatively) the publishing domain and whether they could be concretely adopted by publishers and scholarly data providers;
- the *Academic PC*, who will evaluate the papers from an academic perspective mainly – by assessing the quality of the research described in such papers.

All submissions will be reviewed by (at least) one Senior PC member, one Industrial PC member and two Academic PC members. The final decision of acceptance/rejection will be made in consensus by the chairs.
