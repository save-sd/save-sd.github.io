			<h1>Abstract</h1>
			<p>Bibliographies are fundamental tools for research communities. Besides the obvious
				uses as connection to previous research, citations are also widely used for
				evaluation purposes: the productivity of researchers, departments and universities
				is increasingly measured by counting their citations. Unfortunately, citations
				counters are just rough indicators: a deeper knowledge of individual citations –
				where, when, by whom and why – improves research evaluation tasks and supports
				researchers in their daily activity. Yet, such information is mostly hidden within
				repositories of scholarly papers and is still difficult to find, navigate and make
				use of. </p>
			<p>In this paper, we present a novel tool for exploring scientific articles through
				their citations. The environment is built on top of a rich citation network, encoded
				as a LOD, and includes a user-friendly interface to access, filter and highlight
				information about bibliographic data. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Researchers spend a lot of time in exploring bibliographies. When writing a paper,
				when exploring a new research area, when evaluating papers, they use bibliographies
				for finding related works. Starting from one paper, researchers are interested
				in the papers cited by that one and those it cites. It is not a case that digital
				libraries of scholarly papers - such as ACM DL, IEEE Xplore DL - show bibliographic
				references and incoming citations in separate lists, that can be often explored even
				if the full-text of the paper is not available. </p>
			<p>Digital libraries show bibliographies are 'monolithic' units, so that users cannot
				process bibliographic items separately. Consider, for instance, the case of a user
				checking how outdated the references of a paper are. There is no other choice than
				inspecting the references and manually filtering outdated ones. Similarly, counting
				self-citations requires users to manually inspect the reference list.</p>
			<p>Even if performing these task is not a huge issue on a single paper, it's still
				time-consuming and difficult when dealing with several papers. The aggravating
				factor is that, often, these tasks have to be completed under pressure: who can say
				that he had never written a review right before the (extended) deadline? Or made an
				initial selection of papers in a few hours? Or even arranged a related works section
				in short time?</p>
			<p>Our research aims at supporting researchers in these daily tasks, making it easy to
				access data that otherwise are hard to find, inspect and filter.</p>
			<p>The problem can be broken in two parts. First, we need rich data about papers (e.g.
				author list, publication year, venue, etc.) and citation networks (e.g. about
				incoming/outgoing citations). For instance, it is useful and challenging to capture
				the original <em>citation context</em><em> - </em>defined in <span rel="frbr:part"><a href="#QazvinianContextWindow" typeof="c4o:InTextReferencePointer" about="in-text-reference-pointer-QazvinianContextWindow"> </a></span><span about="in-text-reference-pointer-QazvinianContextWindow"><span rel="c4o:hasContext"><span resource="citation-context-QazvinianContextWindow" typeof="doco:Sentence" property="c4o:hasContent" content="For instance, it is useful and challenging to capture the original  citation context  -  defined in  [QazvinianContextWindow] as  the sentence of the original paper where a particular work was cited"/></span><span property="c4o:hasContent" content="[QazvinianContextWindow]"/><span rel="c4o:denotes" resource="bibliographic-reference-QazvinianContextWindow"/></span> as
				the sentence of the original paper where a particular work was cited - and the
					<em>citation function</em>, defined in <span rel="frbr:part"><a href="#TeufelCitationFunction" typeof="c4o:InTextReferencePointer" about="in-text-reference-pointer-TeufelCitationFunction"> </a></span><span about="in-text-reference-pointer-TeufelCitationFunction"><span rel="c4o:hasContext"><span resource="citation-context-TeufelCitationFunction" typeof="doco:Sentence" property="c4o:hasContent" content="For instance, it is useful and challenging to capture the  citation function, defined in  [TeufelCitationFunction] as the reason why a paper is cited"/></span><span property="c4o:hasContent" content="[TeufelCitationFunction]"/><span rel="c4o:denotes" resource="bibliographic-reference-TeufelCitationFunction"/></span> as
				the reason why a paper is cited. Having such data can be very helpful to understand
				the nature of citations and to give them more or less importance.</p>
			<p>The second issue consists in providing users with intuitive interfaces to read and
				make sense of these data - for instance, to easily filter data, to navigate paper
				collections, to explore citations, along with their functions and contexts. </p>
			<p>This paper focuses on the second aspect, though some discussion is provided about the
				underlying data model and source. In fact, we briefly introduce the Semantic Lancet
				Triplestore (SLT), a LOD dataset including detailed information about citations, and then
				we go into details of BEX, a novel environment for accessing these data.</p>
			<p>The structure of the paper is as follows. <a href="#SectionRelated"> </a>
				describes some related works; some issues in daily tasks on citations, along with
				possible improvements, are investigated in <a href="#SectionTaskAnalysis"> </a>; <a href="#SectionSpar"> </a> gives
				some background on the Semantic Lancet Triplestore; BEX is introduced in <a href="#SectionBiblioexplorer"> </a>; the evaluation of the current

			<p>A large variety of systems support the exploration of scholarly data, some of them
				providing an interface to a specific repository of bibliographic information, others
				integrating multiple data sources to provide access to a richer set of data and
				navigation functionalities. Some well-known platforms are Google Scholar<a href="#ftn5"> </a>, DBLP<a href="#ftn6"> </a>
				and CiteSeerX<a href="#ftn7"> </a>. These systems are not designed
				to support sense-making tasks in the academic domain. On the contrary, Microsoft
				Academic Search<a href="#ftn8"> </a> provides a variety of
				visualizations, including co-authorship graphs, publication trends, and
				co-authorship paths between authors.

			<p>There is an ever increasing interest in making bibliographic data also available as

				is available, through SPARQL end-points. For instance, DBLP++<a href="#ftn10"> </a> makes available RDF data corresponding to those collected in

				peculiar aspects is that BioTea gives a lot of relevance to the content, providing
				abstracts for all papers and expressing in RDF some structural components such as
				sections, paragraphs, etc. There are no citation contexts and functions but the
				dataset could be easily extended in that direction.</p>

			<h1>Research-related tasks on bibliographies</h1>
			<p>The great amount of data available on citations and, in particular, the possibility
				of navigating papers through citations are powerful tools in the hand of the
				researchers. Researcher performs different tasks on citations according to the role
				they play. The researcher is first of all a <em>reader</em>, who reads articles and
				navigate them through citations. The process of finding relevant works is very
				common when writing new papers and project proposals: indeed, a researcher is also
				an <em>author</em>. The research community also relies on peer-review processes, which
				require researchers to also act as <em>reviewers</em> or <em>editors</em>. When
				reviewing papers, a researcher uses citations and checks, for instance, the number
				of self-citations or the publication year of the cited papers. Citations are also
				increasingly used for evaluation purposes. Researchers are then asked to be part of
				academic boards in charge of evaluating research products. Our analysis covers such
				a scenario with a specific role: <em>evaluator</em>. Researchers are involved in
				organizing scientific events, thus we added the role of <em>event organizer.</em></p>
			<p>In this section we describe some of the most common tasks that researchers perform on
				bibliographies when playing all these roles. There are many other tasks
				characterizing each of these roles but they are left out of discussion, since they
				are not specific on bibliographies. </p>
			<p><a href="#TableTasks"> </a> summarises our analysis. The discussion uses
				the well-known terminology of <span rel="frbr:part"><a href="#Preece94" typeof="c4o:InTextReferencePointer" about="in-text-reference-pointer-Preece94"> </a></span><span about="in-text-reference-pointer-Preece94"><span rel="c4o:hasContext"><span resource="citation-context-Preece94" typeof="doco:Sentence" property="c4o:hasContent" content="The discussion uses the well-known terminology of  [Preece94]"/></span><span property="c4o:hasContent" content="[Preece94]"/><span rel="c4o:denotes" resource="bibliographic-reference-Preece94"/></span>: the term <em>goal</em> is used to indicate a final objective a
				user wishes to achieve, a <em>task</em> is a sequence of one or more activities the
				user thinks are required to achieve a goal. Each task is specific of a peculiar user
					<em>role</em>. Note also that we did not decompose each task in hierarchical
				subtasks, for the sake of simplicity. </p>

				<figcaption>Common tasks on bibliographies, for different classes of
					users.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Task 1 consists in building or updating a bibliography on a given topic. A common
				approach is to use keyword-based search tools, scan the list of returned papers and
				filter potentially relevant ones. Researchers might read abstracts to have a clearer
				idea of each paper. Further candidates are often searched by analysing citation
				networks: starting from a list of relevant papers, incoming and outgoing citations
				are scanned and, in turn, new candidates are analysed and, if relevant, added to the
				list. The criteria used to discern among papers may vary a lot: considering the
				total number of citations may be a suitable indicator to identify seminal papers,
				whereas it may fail when searching for recent developments or cutting edge works. In
				the second case, other criteria such as the publication date are more convenient. In
				all cases, the researchers have to inspect the list of citations and to manually
				find relevant information. </p>
			<p>Tasks 2 is performed by researchers as reviewers. To evaluate if a paper is
				up-to-date, they inspect the bibliography and look at the publication year of each
				item. Furthermore they check if any relevant recent paper is not cited. These
				operations are still manual. One of the reasons is that, in almost all cases, papers
				under revision are PDFs and the bibliographic references cannot be processed as
				separate units. </p>
			<p>The same applies to Tasks 3 and 4. The first one covers the analysis of
				self-citations: in fact, the reviewers/editors check how many cited papers are
				written by the same authors (or some of them). The editors/reviewers might also want
				to check the number of papers cited by a paper submitted to a journal and published
				in the same journal. That might be an indicator of the suitability of that paper for
				that journal.</p>
			<p>The evaluation of research works (Task 5) and researchers (Task 6) is often performed
				by counting the incoming citations to each research work and by aggregating them for
				further analysis. Thus, evaluators need to easily access information about the
				number of times each paper is cited and to know how those citations
				are distributed in time. One aspect that
				is still under-estimated when evaluating citations is their nature. In fact, not all citations
				are equal: some are given just for information, some as necessary background, some
				refers to a work the citing paper is an extension of. It would be useful to store
				and be able to analyse citations together with the sentence to which they belong to
					(<em>citation context</em>), or together with information about the reason why a
				paper is cited (<em>citation</em><em> function</em>). A time perspective is helpful
				here. For instance, we can expect that an important work is referenced for
				information or used as background for many years, but if it keep being extended, or
				some methods therein contained are used for a long time, it means it still plays an
				active and important role. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing
				repositories of scholarly papers make such information available.</p>
			<p>There is a further common task that researchers perform by exploring papers and
				citations: finding experts in a given topic or simply people who are interested in
				that topic. These people usually are searched among the authors of relevant papers
				--- that, as discussed so far, are found by exploiting citations too. Such expert
				finding task might be useful, for instance, when searching for potential
				participants to a scientific events (Task 7).</p>
		</section>
		<section id="SectionSpar">
			<h1>Publishing and exploring data on citations: SPAR and Semantic Lancet</h1>
			<p>Even though existing repositories make bibliographies available as separate units,
				the lists of references are treated as `monolithic' units: the users can export
				citations and navigate to the cited/citing papers but they are not allowed to filter
				bibliographic references, or to show only some references, or to show detailed
				information about each reference. </p>
			<p>This is first of all a problem of usability due to the lack of specific
				functionalities. But it also depends on the way data are structured and made
				available. In fact, most of the existing repositories do not offer APIs to access
				data (e.g. Google Scholar) or offer partial APIs that do not cover all needed
				aspects (e.g. ScienceDirect and Scopus). </p>
			<p>Our approach to address these issues consists of two steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>building a LOD on scholarly publications, that includes rich information
						about papers and citation networks</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>providing users with an intuitive interface to access, explore and make use
						of these data</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The paper is focused on the second aspect but we need some background about the
				underlying data source. Thus, here we present SPAR, the set of ontologies used in
				our system, and the Semantic Lancet Triplestore (SLT), a SPARQL end-point build on
				top of SPAR and used as backend.</p>
			<section>
				<h1>SPAR and SLT</h1>
				<p>SPAR<a href="#ftn12"> </a> is a set of OWL ontologies that
					describe the most relevant aspects of the publishing process, with particular
					attention to scholarly publications<span rel="frbr:part"><a href="#PeroniSPAR" typeof="c4o:InTextReferencePointer" about="in-text-reference-pointer-PeroniSPAR"> </a></span><span about="in-text-reference-pointer-PeroniSPAR"><span rel="c4o:hasContext"><span resource="citation-context-PeroniSPAR" typeof="doco:Sentence" property="c4o:hasContent" content="SPAR is a set of OWL ontologies that describe the most relevant aspects of the publishing process, with particular attention to scholarly publications [PeroniSPAR]"/></span><span property="c4o:hasContent" content="[PeroniSPAR]"/><span rel="c4o:denotes" resource="bibliographic-reference-PeroniSPAR"/></span>. We adopted
					some of them in our project. FaBiO describes the core metadata associated to
					scholarly articles (e.g., authors, title, DOI); it is then used to create
					accurate and unambiguous representation of each paper.</p>
				<p>The CiTO ontology<a href="#ftn13"> </a> introduces the
						<em>cito:cites</em> property to indicate that a given paper cites another one.
					The interesting aspect is that CiTO also defines a list of properties that
					specialise <em>cito:cites</em> and capture <em>citation functions</em> (for
					instance, <em>cito:extends</em>, <em>cito:usesMethodIn</em>,
						<em>cito:disagreesWith</em>). Thus, users can deeply characterise citations,
					though this still remains a difficult task, with a very low agreement among
						humans<span rel="frbr:part"><a href="#CiancariniEvaluatingCiTO" typeof="c4o:InTextReferencePointer" about="in-text-reference-pointer-CiancariniEvaluatingCiTO"> </a></span><span about="in-text-reference-pointer-CiancariniEvaluatingCiTO"><span rel="c4o:hasContext"><span resource="citation-context-CiancariniEvaluatingCiTO" typeof="doco:Sentence" property="c4o:hasContent" content="Thus, users can deeply characterise citations, though this still remains a difficult task, with a very low agreement among humans [CiancariniEvaluatingCiTO]"/></span><span property="c4o:hasContent" content="[CiancariniEvaluatingCiTO]"/><span rel="c4o:denotes" resource="bibliographic-reference-CiancariniEvaluatingCiTO"/></span>. The BiRO ontology (<em>BiRO</em>)<a href="#ftn14"> </a> allows users to describe bibliographic references and
					their compilation into reference lists. This is a key aspect for our approach:
					the internal organisation of the references of a paper is fully captured, so
					that bibliographic items can be manipulated as separate units. The C4O ontology
					makes it possible to capture the <em>citation context</em> of each citation; it
					also includes a mechanism for counting citations locally (within an article) or
					globally (by means of particular platforms). These values can be used for
					evaluation purposes and to measure the impact of each paper, as discussed in <a href="#SectionTaskAnalysis"> </a>. More details about BiRO and
					C4O can be found in <span rel="frbr:part"><a href="#DiIorioBiRO" typeof="c4o:InTextReferencePointer" about="in-text-reference-pointer-DiIorioBiRO"> </a></span><span about="in-text-reference-pointer-DiIorioBiRO"><span rel="c4o:hasContext"><span resource="citation-context-DiIorioBiRO" typeof="doco:Sentence" property="c4o:hasContent" content="More details about BiRO and C4O can be found in  [DiIorioBiRO]"/></span><span property="c4o:hasContent" content="[DiIorioBiRO]"/><span rel="c4o:denotes" resource="bibliographic-reference-DiIorioBiRO"/></span>. </p>
				<p>The <em>Semantic Lancet Triplestore</em> (SLT) is a freely available LOD dataset
					built on top of these ontologies<a href="#ftn15"> </a>. SLT
					includes rich data about scholarly papers, that range from a large network of
					citations, to semantically-enriched abstracts, from provenance data to
					time-aware descriptions of the articles. The current dataset describes all
					papers published in the Journal of Web Semantics by Elsevier, though we are
					working to add data about articles of other journals. SLT contains bibliographic
					records and full details about citations, and is used as primary data source for
					our application called BEX.</p>

				“Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand”. </p>
			<p>The navigation starts with three search functionalities: in addition to the classical
				string search on author and title, the user can also search relevant papers
				according to their content. This search is performed by an external service. Other
				services, for instance based on full-text search or other mining techniques, can be
				integrated with a few modifications to BEX.</p>
			<p>We achieved good results by exploiting a service called Abstract Finder<a href="#ftn17"> </a>. It relies on FRED<span rel="frbr:part"><a href="#FRED12" typeof="c4o:InTextReferencePointer" about="in-text-reference-pointer-FRED12"> </a></span><span about="in-text-reference-pointer-FRED12"><span rel="c4o:hasContext"><span resource="citation-context-FRED12" typeof="doco:Sentence" property="c4o:hasContent" content="It  relies on FRED [FRED12]  "/></span><span property="c4o:hasContent" content="[FRED12]"/><span rel="c4o:denotes" resource="bibliographic-reference-FRED12"/></span> and exploits the semantic information about concepts, events,
				roles and named entities contained in the paper abstracts and extracted from the text with NLP techniques. Thus, through BEX a researcher can write in the search box a
				tentative abstract for her/his paper to retrieve meaningful papers that match with
				it from a pure textual but also semantic point of view, as shown in <a href="#FigureSearchRes"> </a>.</p>

				<figcaption>The list of papers shown in BEX, with information about abstract
					and citations, and details about the outgoing citations.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The results are organized as a list of papers, ordered by default from the most
				recent to the oldest one. Through the sorting box at the top of the interface, the
				user can easily define custom criterion to order the results (i.e. year, title, number of
				citations) and the order type. For each returned paper, BEX shows a summary of basic
				information and a link to the paper official page on Elsevier's ScienceDirect.</p>
			<p>In order to gather more information about a paper in the list, the user can open a
				sliding box showing the full abstract and data on citations. The information about
				the citations is organized in two parts: <em>outgoing</em> and <em>incoming</em>.</p>
			<p>By clicking on the "Show items" button, the user can get access to the information
				about the <em>outgoing citations</em>, as shown in the central part of <a href="#FigureSearchRes"> </a>. BEX organizes the cited papers in a vertical list.
				For each paper BEX shows (from left to right): the number of times in which the
				paper is referenced by the paper under examination, some general information about
				the paper, and a piechart summarizing the number and type of citations received from
				the focus paper. Moreover, abstract, citation functions and contexts are shown in popups
				windows.</p>
			<figure id="FigureIncoming">
				<p><img class="6.6929in-4.3772in" src="1000020100000650000004217B9C8FF7.png" alt="The popup window with information about the function of the incoming citations of a paper."/></p>
				<figcaption>The popup window with information about the function of the
					incoming citations of a paper.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>In the <em>incoming citation</em> section, two counters show the number of <em>global</em> and
					<em>internal</em> citations received by the paper under examination. The term
				'global' here indicates citations for a paper as counted by external services
				(Scopus); the term 'internal' indicates the citations given by papers described in
				our dataset (published in the Journal of Web Semantics).</p>
			<p>Further details about the citation functions of incoming internal citations are
				available. As shown in <a href="#FigureIncoming"> </a>, this information
				is presented in a popup window organized in three parts: a pie chart gives an
				overview of the number and type of incoming citations (top left), a column chart
				shows the distribution of the citation functions on a time axis (top right), and
				details about the citation contexts are presented in the bottom. In the two charts
				at the top of the page, different colors are used to encode the function of each
				single citation, and citations with the same function are grouped together. Finally,
				the last component shows, for each paper citing the paper under focus, the list of
				the citation contexts.</p>
			<p>Finally, BEX provides a rich list of filtering capabilities and ordering criteria that can
				used to focus on different aspects of the internal citation network. The filtering
				functionality, for instance, allows users to filter papers by year, by author and by
				citation function, optionally excluding self-citations.</p>

		<section id="SectionDiscussion">
			<h1>Discussion and conclusions</h1>
			<p>BEX was built to successfully carry out the tasks discussed in <a href="#SectionTaskAnalysis"> </a>. For instance, let us consider Task 1,
				building/updating a bibliography on a specific topic. Once loaded, BEX directly
				shows the form to insert the topic to be analysed as a keyword list, a short description
				or a longer text. No further steps are required and this command is consistently
				available in the left sidebar. Since the candidate papers of a search are organized
				as a list of expandable items, users can easily read all abstracts by simply
				scrolling the main window. No further tab or window is opened and the reading
				process is direct. Note also that other services for searching relevant papers – for
				instance based on full-text search – can be integrated with a few modifications to
				BEX.</p>
			<p>For each paper in the list, BEX also shows its bibliography in the main panel rather
				than in a separate tab or modal window. This is helpful to quickly check other
				potential candidates. The incoming citations, on the other hand, are shown in a
				separate window. For each of them, BEX provides authorship data, publication year,
				global citations and abstract. The user can then check indirect references, i.e.,
				other potentially relevant papers, with minimal effort. Note that BEX is currently
				limited since only data about citations and papers of JWS are available. But this is
				a limitation of the dataset, not of the application. We are hard working to expand
				the dataset and to integrate it with other sources.</p>
			<p>Additionally, a breadcrumb toolbar tracks all papers accessed during the navigation,
				so that users can overcome disorientation by rolling back to a paper already
				visited, and a clickable list of the authors shows details of
				all the papers written by each author. The possibility of navigating papers of an
				author and contextually reading their abstracts is also useful to complete Task
				7.</p>
			<p>Filters showing only the papers of a given author or published after a given year are
				particularly useful to perform Task 1-5, since the user can enable the appropriate
				filters and the list of citations is automatically updated. Self-citations deserve a
				special mention: BEX highlights them with a special icon in all lists, and not only
				when filtered. This information is constantly available and the users can make use
				of it it in all tasks.</p>
			<p>There is a critical issue on Tasks 2-4 (review process). BEX cannot be used directly
				when reviewing papers submitted as PDF, as semantically-enriched data about
				citations are not available. On the other hand, there is lively discussion in the
				community about using alternative formats for submissions, for instance in RASH<a href="#ftn19"> </a> as proposed for the SAVE-SD workshop, that could
				be automatically converted in semantic data processable by BEX<a href="#ftn18"> </a>. Bibliographies could also be extracted from PDF sources and
				enhanced with semantic data through automatic conversion processes. </p>
			<p>The most interesting aspect of BEX with regard to Tasks 5 and 6 is the availability
				of citation functions and contexts. These make evident the origin and the actual
				impact of each citation. Such data are also useful for checking if the citation
				function is correct, since contexts and functions in SLT were extracted by automatic
				tools.</p>
			<p>We plan to integrate bookmarks functionalities so that users can keep track of
				relevant information while navigating. Additionally, we are investigating further
				searching and filtering options. The need for these additional features have been
				highlighted by our preliminary analysis, but we plan to perform many more structured
				and complete tests on BEX, and to study how the tool is used by different classes of
				users.</p>
