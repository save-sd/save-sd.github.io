An award of 250 euros as a voucher for buying Springer Nature's products, kindly sponsored by [Springer Nature](http://www.springernature.com), will be assigned to the best workshop submission in [HTML](submission.html#instructions). The decision will be taken by considering the quality of the markup (i.e., the less syntactical mistakes there are in the markup, the better) and the number of RDF statements defined.
