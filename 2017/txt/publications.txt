All the papers of SAVE-SD will be made available on the workshop website and published in a [Lecture Notes in Computer Science](http://www.springer.com/lncs) volume by [Springer](http://www.springer.com, final confirmation pending). The LNCS volume will be published after the workshop in order to give the authors an opportunity to revise their papers in the light of the discussions of their works at the workshop. Note that the WWW 2017 organisers will require that at least one of the authors of the papers accepted will be registered at the workshop.

We are also pleased to announce a special issues for workshop papers. As in the last edition, the authors of selected papers (of any [type](#kinds)) of the workshop will be invited to submit an extended version of their works to a special issue that will be published as part of [Data Science Journal](http://datasciencehub.net/) published by IOS Press, which is a new open access journal covering all subject areas related to SAVE-SD.
