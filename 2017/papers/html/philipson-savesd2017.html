            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>The findability and interoperability of some Permanent Identifiers (PIDs) in use on
                the internet and their compliance with the FAIR data principles <a
                    href="#fair-2016a"> </a> are explored. It is suggested that the wide
                distribution and <em>findability</em> (e.g. by simple 'googling') on the internet
                may be more important for the usefulness of identifiers, than the
                    <em>resolvability</em> of links by one single authority, purportedly
                guaranteeing their permanence and authenticity. The prevalence of phenomena such as
                    <em>link rot</em> implies that the permanence of URLs, PURLs or URIs cannot be
                trusted. By contrast, the well distributed, but seldom directly resolvable ISBN
                identifier has proved remarkably resilient, with far-reaching persistence, inherent
                structural meaning and good <em>validatability</em>, by means of fixed
                string-length, pattern-recognition, restricted character set and check digit. Adding
                    <em>context</em> and meaning to identifiers through namespace prefixes and
                object types is also suggested. Arguing for a wide distribution of validatable
                identifiers, the conclusion resembles the experience of the boy Marcus in the
                novel-based film <em>About a boy</em>, from living with a suicidal mother: It's not
                sufficient to rely on one source only for sustenance. You need more than that. You
                need backup, in case something happens.<a href="#hornby-1998"> </a>

            <h1>Introduction: Identifiers in science</h1>
            <p>Identifiers in science may refer to digital or physical objects, or concepts. They
                may be general or domain-specific. Among the more prevalent general PID, permanent
                identifier types are DOI, Handle and UUID. There are also 'old', bibliographic
                identifiers like ISBN. Created in the 1960's and -70's of the print era, how come
                they survived into this digital age? Some reasons might be: they are well
                distributed across the internet, and widely used by stake-holders (libraries,
                publishers, readers). They have a semantic structure, identifying well-defined
                objects, and a fairly precise validation mechanism through fixed string-lengths,
                limited character-set and check digits. Some of these properties of good identifiers
                are shared by DOIs, Handles and UUIDs, or other more domain specific identifiers
                used for scholarly data, but seldom all of them simultaneously. Among these
                characteristics the main focus here will be on validation, as seemingly somewhat
                neglected lately.</p>


        </section>

        <section id="sec_identifiers">
            <h1>Identifiers - why do we need them?</h1>

            <p>The general purpose of identifiers is to serve as <em>references</em> to the objects
                that they are supposed to identify. This requires identifiers to indicate,
                preferably in and by themselves, what <em>type of objects</em> they are meant to
                identify. Now, far from all identifiers fulfil this requirement. Rather, it is often
                left to the <em>names</em> of things to <em>describe</em> the objects identified,
                thereby providing context and <em>meaning</em>. Scientific names may or may not be
                part of the metadata on the destination page of a PID-URI.</p>
                <p>While scientific <em>names</em> are often useful for <em>describing</em> objects (or
                at least certain aspects or properties of 'things', organisms), they have other
                drawbacks compared to identifiers, some of which were identified by <a
                    href="#patterson-2016"> </a>. For example, homonymi and disambiguation should
                generally be a lesser problem for globally unique identifiers. And while
                concatenations or abbreviations may be problematic in the use of names for
                identification, string-length restrictions and pattern limits are useful for
                validation of identifiers, as is avoiding white space. Missing or added characters,
                all types of misspellings are easier to detect and validate in standardized
                identifiers of fixed string-length or well-defined character patterns. Inconsistent
                encoding should generally also not be a problem in good identifiers, for which the
                set of allowed characters may be limited. However, these assets of some identifiers
                may conflict with the legitimate interest in having also transparent, meaningful
                PIDs that at least in part "speak for themselves". The result of a compromise
                between these two interests may be seen in the <em>Handle</em> (hdl) system
                (below).</p>

            <p>The FAIR principles clearly need interpretation to become fully operational, as
                several observers have noted, and such work is also in progress. <a

                    <p>1.1. The same Data Object should be re-findable at any point in time, thus

                <li>
                    <p>3.1. (Meta) data is machine-actionable [8. ... <q>Metadata being machine
                            readable is a <em>conditio sine qua non</em> for FAIRness.</q>] <a

                <li>

                        like-with-like, with other data sources </p>
                </li>
                <!--  -->
            </ul>
            <p> The FAIR principles have some resemblance with the Linked Data rules first fomulated
                by Tim Berners-Lee already back in 2006, updated in 2009 and 2010.<a
                    href="#berners-lee-2009"> </a> There is, for example, the insistence on
                machine-readability and the linking of data sources with other data. But the FAIR
                principles do not necessarily require metadata to be expressed in RDF, as the Linked
                Data rules demand. It seems also that Berners-Lee is critical of identifier types
                using other schemes than simple HTTP URIs.</p>

            <p>Neither the FAIR principles, nor the Linked Data rules say anything explicitly about
                    <em>validation</em>. Still, particularly for the <em>Interoperability</em> and
                    <em>Re-usability</em>, it is crucial that metadata can be properly validated
                against a schema, as adhering to an accepted metadata standard. And this includes
                also identifiers. We must be sure that they are of the type or format they claim to
                be, even if they cannot be resolved to a dedicated URI any longer. Failed
                validation, e.g. due to simple typos or wrong namespace, may even be one way of
                checking why an identifier or URI does not resolve as expected. It is also important
                for the possibility to export metadata to another format, thereby promoting the
                re-use of data, without exporting also potential errors. Although transformation or
                harvesting of metadata might be possible even without validation, the trust in the
                results and quality as well as the eventual findability of the data (and so again
                the re-usability) might be seriously affected.
                For enhanced findability, it is also important that standard, widely distributed
                identifiers are used.</p>

            <p>Validation of an identifier means ensuring that it is true to its proclaimed type,
                for example, making sure that what is flagged as an ISBN is not in fact an ISSN
                (real use case), or that the string-length and check-sum is compliant with its type.
                A further advantage of promptly validatable identifiers, as against relying
                exclusively on resolvability, is that validation can be performed also off-line, by
                means of a more or less simple validation-algorithm and a piece of software such as
                a resonably good XML-editor.</p>

            <h1>Resolvable or findable?</h1>

            <p>In the present FAIR principles the focus is very much on resolvability of identifiers
                by an authority <a href="#fair-2016b"> </a>, despite the general awareness of
                phenomena like 'link rot' and 'reference rot'.<a href="#gertler-2017"> </a><a
                    href="#jones_etal-2016"> </a><a href="#linkrotwiki-2017"> </a> It has even been
                suggested to put up digital gravestones over disappeared resources, with metadata
                from their last known whereabouts serving as epitaphs.<a href="#clark-2016"> </a> A
                2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed nearly 15,000 links in abstracts from
                Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science citation index and found that the median lifespan of
                web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.<a href="#hennessey-2013"> </a>
                This happens although there is an understanding that <q>[u]nique identifiers, and
                    metadata describing the data, and its disposition, should persist -- even beyond
                    the lifespan of the data they describe</q>.<a href="#force11-2014"> </a> A
                recent study of some 40 research data repositories found that only one of these (3%)
                was compliant with the FAIR principle of Accessibility requiring <q>a clear policy
                    statement (or various examples of data this has actually happened to) indicating
                    that metadata is still available even if the data is removed.</q> <a
                    href="#dunning-2017"> </a> The argument here, though, is not that resolvable,
                permanent URIs should be avoided as identifiers; in fact, they often do serve
                their purpose of providing a more persistent metadata source than "ordinary", plain
                URLs. But, as has been eloquently remarked, "persistent URIs must be used to be
                    persistent".<a href="#vandesompel-2016a"> </a> Persistent, resolvable URIs as
                identifiers work by means of a decoupling of the location and the identification
                functions of URIs.</p>
                <blockquote><p>                    
                 The custodian of a web resource maintains the correspondence
                    between the identifying URI and the locating URI in the resolver’s look-up table
                    as the resource’s location changes over time. ... The solution comes at a price
                    because it requires operating a resolver infrastructure and maintaining the
                    look-up table that powers it.<a href="#vandesompel-2016a"> </a></p></blockquote> 
            <p>This is
                true of DOIs, as well as Handles, PURLs and URNs. There are in fact numerous cases
                when the lookup-table is not maintained and updated as required. That is why it may
                be wise not to rely on a single 'custodian' for the resolution of identifiers and
                access to associated metadata. It is rather the <em>distribution</em> and use of
                identifiers - whether resolvable or not - that is important here. It seems not even
                the authors of <a href="#vandesompel-2016a"> </a> are true to their own principles,
                since three of their references that actually have DOIs are cited without them: <a
                    href="#duerr-2011"> </a>
                <a href="#klein_etal-2014"> </a>
                <a href="#zhou-2015"> </a>. So again, PIDs must be used and cited to remain
                permanent. Citations may also serve as a 'means of transportation' to achieve widest possible
                distribution. Further, it may be argued that wide distribution is <em>dependent</em>
                on good 'validatability', in order not to multiply errors and 'non-resolution' as a
                result.</p>

            <p>One way to achieve wider distribution of identifiers might be the praiseworthy
                initiative of <em>signposting.org</em> (see also: <a href="#vandesompel-2016b"
                > </a>), using HTTP headers for retrieval of PIDs from simple URLs:</p>


            <p>
                <code>curl -I "https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.867908" HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                    Content-length: 8424 Content-type: text/html;charset=UTF-8 Link:
                    &lt;https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.867908&gt; ; rel="identifier"</code>
            </p>
            <p>However, the signposting initiative, so far, only redirects the question of use from
                PIDs and DOIs to HTTP header links. Again, going back to the question of
                resolvability, the relationship between identifiers such as DOIs and URIs/IRIs is
                not always straightforward, and sometimes involves a chain of redirects ('303s'),
                before reaching eventually a destination holding also the appropriate metadata.<a
                    href="#wass-2016"> </a><a href="#wass-2017"> </a>. Another reason resolvability
                may not be sufficient, even if the metadata is somehow in place, is that the file on
                the destination page resolved to is behind a paywall. This is a recent case, where
                apparently public domain content more than 100 years old was hidden behind a
                DOI-resolver charging 50$ for release of the content:</p>

            <p>First, it is not true that every object only gets one and only one DOI. It is
                possible to mint several DOIs for the same resource by different agents, such as
                Dataverse, Figshare, ResearchGate etc. The DOI in question here is: <a
                    href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930908692639"
                >10.1080/00222930908692639</a>. Secondly, there are some remedies against these
                cases, notably the recently launched oaDOI at <em>oadoi.org</em>. <a
                    href="#hayes-2016"> </a> We try it out here: </p>

            <p>In several steps this eventually leads us via an API to an XML-file with a link to
                the freely accessible fulltext at <a

                    >http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/60220</a>.
                But, most often you are not so fortunate to find a free replacement copy of resources behind a paywall. What meets you when tested
                in those cases may be this telling message, when tried for the DOI of <a href="#paskin-1999"> </a>:</p>


            <figure id="oaDOIresult2">

            <p>And if <em>oadoi.org</em> (apparently just recently replaced by the browser add-on <em>unpaywall.org</em>) fails, <a
                    href="http://identifiers.org/services/sparql">identifiers.org SPARQL
                    endpoint</a> might be useful.<a href="#wimalaratne-2015"> </a> But, it does
                not necessarily give us an open access URI in return. And it only works if the
                potential corresponding URIs have been assigned the property <em>owl:sameAs</em>
                just as the submitted subject URI. Unfortunately, in neither of our cases above
                these conditions are met.</p>

            <p>Assuming we have finally found a single seemingly reliable custodian of our PIDs and
                URIs, promising 24/7 resolution and top quality metadata, should we rest content
                with that? Most serious lawyers and journalists probably would agree, it is wise not
                too judge by the testimony of a single witness, a single source alone. The evidence
                of at least two, mutually independent witnesses is generally preferred. Clark
                describes <em>multiple resolution</em> as representing a stage in the evolution of
                PIDs, that will eventually be surpassed by a more mature age when we supply also
                    <em>data types</em> to come with the PIDs, in order to make them more machine
                actionable <a href="#clark-2016"> </a>. Providing multiple <em>access</em> to, or
                    <em>identification</em> of resources through PIDs, that are capable of serving
                as trustworthy, competent, valid independent witnesses from different moments in
                time, at different sites, in different places is a good idea. Thus, we accept
                    <q>that an object may have multiple PIDs</q>. Ideally these multiple PIDs should
                get to "know about" each other as a way towards interoperability.<a
                    href="#clark-2016"> </a>. This can be achieved already, e.g. by means of linked
                open data (LOD), sameAs-relationships and tools provided by <em>n2t.net</em>,
                    <em>oadoi.org</em> and the <em>identifiers.org</em> SPARQL endpoint referred to
                above. Multiple identifiers from different namespaces for the same object may even
                be desirable in order to ensure interoperability in different environments.<a
                    href="#paskin-1999"> </a>. It is also in line with the principle of the semantic
                web known as the <em>NUNA, Non-Unique Naming Assumption</em>, implying that
                    <q>things described in RDF data can have more than one name</q> and any object
                may be identified by more than one URI, serving in RDF as 'names' of things.<a
                    href="#coyle-2014"> </a></p>

            <p>However, the conclusion to be drawn from this cartoon and the website <a
                    href="http://yapid.org/">yapid.org</a> with regard to PIDs is not that any
                identifier is as good as the other. In fact, there are significant differences in
                quality between identifiers, particularly in terms of 'validatability' and
                'meaningfulness', or 'semantic weight'. We are getting there a bit later.</p>

            <p>But first, having referred to linked data and sameAs-relationships as a possible
                solution to achieving interoperability, what about long-term sustainability? Are
                LOD, relying heavily on URIs, fit for survival? Archival records for long-term
                preservation need to be self-sustained, carrying meaning within themselves, while
                the references may no longer be resolvable. In e-archives compliant with the
                OAIS-model and Trustworthy Digital Repositories standards for self-sustenance, this
                means that URIs lacking an inherently meaningful structure will often serve only as
                another set of dumb identifiers. Unless they can import some meaning from outside,
                through resolution or sameAs links, such opaque, non-resolvable URIs should
                henceforth rather be described as "non-semantic".</p>

        <section id="which_identifiers">
            <h1>Which identifiers are FAIR enough?</h1>

            <p>We must ask about PIDs, <q>Permanent Identifiers</q>, just how <q>permanent</q> are
                they really? Even if not always resolvable, are they in general still 'findable',
                well distributed over the internet in time and space? Are they 'validatable' (e.g.
                through fixed string-length, pattern-recognition, restricted character set, built-in
                checksum, built-in type?) Are they FAIR?</p>

            <p><strong>Findability:</strong> Beginning with the F for findability, for comparison we
                go back in time to 'old-fashioned' ISBNs, Internaional Standard Book Numbers.
                Publicly declaring what type of objects they are meant to identify, ISBNs are rarely
                directly resolvable. But they are widely distributed, they have good
                    <em>findability</em> in terms of <em>precision</em> hits, as seen by simple
                'googling', with good survival rate, longer than the median age of web-pages 9.3
                years. For example, look at ISBN 0-14-029161-X: <em>The Diversity of Life / Edward
                    O. Wilson (2001)</em>. Simple googling of 014029161X, unprefixed and without
                hyphens results in 57/57 precision hits (date: 2017-01-30). ISBNs could also be
                searched in library catalogs, the most comprehensive of which is probably the <a
                    href="https://kvk.bibliothek.kit.edu/">Karlsruhe Virtual Catalog – KVK
                    worldwide</a>. Result of the query '014029161X', with the same unprefixed ISBN
                without hyphens yields 123/123 precision hits, recall being difficult to compute
                since in 55 of 72 catalogs the search could not be successfully processed or no
                records were found. To counteract the possibly unfair bias with a modern classic
                like this, we try instead an even older, and presumably less well-known example:
                ISBN: 2130381030. <em>L'Identité : séminaire interdisciplinaire dirigé par Claude
                    Lévi-Strauss, 1974-1975</em> (Paris: PUF, 1983). Googling without prefix
                (2130381030) the precision is between 14/39 and 22/50; with prefix (ISBN2130381030)
                it reaches as high as 17/18 (date: 2017-01-30).</p>

            <p>These results could be compared to similar tests for identifiers of one of the most
                well studied organisms of all, the fruitfly <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>.
                Starting with its GBIF ID <a href="http://www.gbif.org/species/5073713">5073713</a>,
                googling the unprefixed pure number gives the modest precision of 1/107 (date:
                2017-01-30). Using instead the <a href="http://resolver.globalnames.org/">Global
                    Names Resolver</a> to get a UUID v. 5 for <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>,
                &lt;gni-uuid&gt;1bc2f359-47e4-5da6-a748-74676b7c8c5d&lt;/gni-uuid&gt;, googling it
                either unprefixed or prefixed gives a zero result (0 recall, 0 precision, date:
                2017-01-30). Trying instead the same UUID in a general search of all databases of
                NCBI, the US National Center for Biotechnology Information), we get 34 'hits' in 13
                different databases, but all wrong (i.e. 0 precision) <a
                    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/?term=1bc2f359-47e4-5da6-a748-74676b7c8c5d"
                    >1bc2f359-47e4-5da6-a748-74676b7c8c5d</a>. Apparently this is because the
                default search algorithm ignores the hyphens, or rather replaces them with a 'OR',
                so that we get chunks of the string interpreted as e.g. part of a gene locus or
                names of clones. Most notably, we get 0 hits in the <a
                    href="ttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/?term=1bc2f359-47e4-5da6-a748-74676b7c8c5d"
                    >NCBI Taxonomy database</a>, that on the face of it would seem to be the most
                relevant to our search. Going back instead to the GBIF, using our gni-uuid for an
                overall search, restricting our search in several steps finally to only species we
                still get a result of 120613 'hits', simply too much to make precision all but
                negligible. So, while the UUID is imminently validatable, with fixed string-length
                and restricted character set, it is neither directly resolvable, nor findable in
                terms of search results. To earn significance and importance as identifiers
                gni-UUIDs must become more findable and re-usable, for example by ping-back and
                auto-update, assigning themselves to the records in the biodiversity database
                sources they were drawn from and make use of schema.org and similar to get incoming
                links and a better ranking in search engines.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Data and (digital) objects are accessible only in so
                far as identifiers are findable or resolvable preferably to open access landing
                pages with either direct availability of resources, or sufficient metadata to direct
                the user to such an access point. In this respect DOIs are often, but not always, as
                good as or sometimes better than ISBNs (for obvious reasons regarding print only
                material), while gni-UUIDs as described above are all but useless. </p>

            <p><strong>Interoperability</strong> and <strong>Re-usability</strong> are both
                intimately associated with 'validatability', as argued above. We will look more into
                detail at the performance of different PIDs regarding this below.</p>

            <p><strong>DOI:</strong> DOIs can look just like anything. Here are some real cases, all
                at the time of writing resolvable and with multiple findability also by simple
                googling, some of them pretty 'old', although they got their DOIs assigned fairly
                recently. One is even from 1977 (doi: 10.1177/030631277700700112), but it still
                produces an impressive precision score of 26/26 or 59/59 (date: 2017-01-30), mostly
                due to it quite high citation rate, yielding hits for all the citing sources.</p>

            <p>Obviously, all these DOIs, whether resolvable or not, vary substantially in
                string-length, from just 17 to over 60 characters, some involving abbreviations of
                journals or organisations, one an ISBN, and some containing characters in need of
                special XML-encoding, different from URI. Note that although the two last items in
                the first group are from the same journal, <em>Scientometrics</em>, they are quite
                different in structure. Anyway, all the items in both groups are valid DOIs and all
                validate against the best we can offer as a schema, with only partial pattern
                recognition:</p>

            <pre><code>
 &lt;sch:rule context="identifier[@type='doi']"&gt;
   &lt;sch:let name="doi-pattern" value="'^(doi:10|10)[.][0-9]{4,}/\S+$'"/&gt;
   &lt;sch:assert test="matches(., $doi-pattern, 'i')">All DOI identifiers must start with 10, followed by a minimum of 4 digits, a '/' and a suffix of any length
   &lt;/sch:assert&gt;
 &lt;/sch:rule&gt;
  </code></pre>

            <p>But, so does this fake DOI equally:</p>

            <pre><code>
            <a about="blubber-2111" typeof="fabio:ResearchPaper" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999">http://dx.doi.org/<span about="blubber-2111" property="prism:doi">10.1001/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999</span></a>
             </code></pre>

            <p>DOIs, as we have seen, unlike ISBNs are difficult to validate accurately. Or rather,
                it is difficult to find sufficiently discriminatory criteria to distinguish proper
                DOIs from fake ones. They have no fixed string-length, to start with, and very
                little of character set restrictions. All we can have is a partial
                recognition-pattern such as the one in the schematron rule above.</p>

            <p><strong>Handle:</strong>The Handle identifier system seems fairly easy and handy at a
                first glance. Only, it comes in two different flavors. One is the semantically
                opaque, which has the structure: <em>Prefix/noid</em> (10079/sqv9sf1), where the
                NOID-part (for Nice Opaque Identifier <a href="#kunze-2006"> </a>) is a 7-character
                long alphanumeric string from the restricted character set
                "0123456789bcdfghjkmnpqrstvwxz", with random minting order.<a href="#guo-2016"> </a>
                The other flavor is the semantically transparent, which could be of three different
                types: the URL handle: <em>Prefix/local-PID</em> (10079/bibid/123456), the user
                handle: <em>Prefix/netid/netid</em> (10079/netid/guoxinji) and the simpler group
                handle: <em>Prefix/group</em> (10079/ISPS). While being more instantly "meaningful",
                providing context, this kind of Handle, however, will prove less "validatable" in
                the sense that there is no longer any fixed string-length or restricted
                character-set. </p>

            <p><strong>UUID</strong> v5 has support within the field of biodiversity taxonomy, as an
                important complement to scientific names.<a href="#patterson-2016"> </a>. They were
                introduced to the field in 2015 by the Global Names Architecture - GNA <a
                    href="#gna-2015"> </a>. The arguments for using them instead of name strings for
                certain functions are that they save space as index keys in databases, they have a
                fixed string length (36 characters, including the dashes) while scientific names are
                of different length. UUIDs do not suffer, as names sometimes do, from encoding
                problems that are difficult to detect and they are more easily distinguishable one
                from the other than name strings for closely related species variants. Specifically,
                it is argued that <q>UUIDs v5 ... can be generated independently by anybody and
                    still be the same to the same name string... Same ID can be generated in any
                    popular language following well-defined algorithm.</q> The corresponding <a
                    href="http://globalnames.org/apps/gn-uuid/">Ruby Gem app</a> is described thus:
                    <q>Creates UUID version 5 out of scientific name string. It uses globalnames.org
                    domain for DNS namespace. There is a 1:1 relationship between the string and the
                    corresponding UUID, so it allows globally connect data about a name string
                    originated from independent sources without a need to negotiate identifiers.</q>
                Note, however, that it is actually the specific<em>name</em> string that is
                identified here, not the object, the organism, the 'thing itself'. Thus, the
                resulting UUID is completely dependent upon the particular name string (with its
                encoding), it cannot be used as a bridge between different name forms for the same
                organism, telling us that they are naming the same object. This is due to the fact
                that it is <q>generated by hashing a namespace identifier and name</q>. <a
                    href="#UUID-2017"> </a> By contrast, the UUID v5 is easily validated, e.g. with
                an <a href="http://www.freecodeformat.com/validate-uuid-guid.php">online
                    validator</a>.</p>

        <section id="sec_why_context">
            <h1> Why context?</h1>

            <p>Generally speaking, although it is preferable that identifiers be findable and
                identifiable also in their unprefixed, pure form, typed identifiers give context by
                means of namespace prefixes of a metadata standard, a vocabulary or ontology. They
                tell us what kind of identifier it is and sometimes what kind of objects it is used
                for (e.g. ISBN), but not always (cf. DOI, EAN, UUID). Most importantly they indicate
                what schema, which rules should be used for their validation.</p>

            <p> Page <a href="#page-2016"> </a> claimed that e.g. "dc:title" is adding "unnecessary
                complexity (why do we need to know that it's a "dc" title?)" in the JSON
                expression:</p>
            <pre><code> { "@context": { "dc:title": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title" },
                "dc:title": "Darwin Core: An Evolving Community-Developed Biodiversity Data
                Standard" }</code></pre>

            <p>A simple answer is that namespaces are important to retain meaning from context,
                serving as a key to interpretation for the future. Self-sustained long-term
                preservation should ideally mean in a case like this that the dc specification and
                schemas valid at the time be archived together with the records, or at least that
                there is provenance metadata including timestamps and namespace of terms used.
                Metadatafiles in XML usually have a xsi:schemaLocation indicating which schema to
                validate against, possibly also its @version. This information, together with
                timestamped metadata elements such as 'dateIssued' should be sufficient to provide
                context. For JSON metadata there are name/value pairs such as { "protocol": "doi",
                ... "createTime": "2017-01-12T10:49:03Z", ...} that could fill the same function.
                Secondly, context is just as important for validation of records also in the
                present. </p>

        <section id="sec_new_DOI">
            <h1>A new contextual, integrated, validatable DOI - a BUOI?</h1>

            <p>As we have seen in the case of Handle above, validatability sometimes comes at a
                cost: transparency lost. Are we forced to make a choice between the two, then, and
                let identifiers be fully validatable while we let associated, linked scientific
                names stand for transparency and meaning? Or, can we create identifiers that are
                both fully validatable and at the same time more meaningful, providing context? So,
                here we finally suggest such a 'yapid' model for a 'BUOI' (Best Unique Object
                Identifier):</p>
            <pre><code><em>Model</em>: [namespace prefix].[object type].[object id: 10 positions]_[version]_.[issued date:YYYY-MM-DD].[registrant: org.id/ORCID]
                </code></pre>

            <pre><code><em>Example (expression of this paper)</em>: fabio.Preprint.philipson1_v1-1_.2017-03-25.0000-0001-5699-994X</code></pre>


            <p> It is a model of a structured, contextual, modular, validatabale identifier. To make
                it easier to implement, and more generazibale, there is no requirement of fixed
                string-length for the two first modules. This means already existing namespaces and
                object types could already be used to create a BUOI.</p>

            <p>Each module/section may hold both letter characters and digits from a limited
                character set. The full stop (.) was chosen as module separator, since it works well
                in both xml- and http-environments, without encoding, and is not subject to
                confusion as sometimes hyphens and dashes (en-dash and em-dash) can be. It also
                works for tokenization of strings. The object type identified in the second module
                should belong to the initial namespace prefix. Every namespace can have as many
                object types as it likes. Namespace schemas could also define valid <em>data
                    types</em> for their different object types, thus moving a step further towards
                supplying <em>data types</em> to come with the PIDs, in order to make them more
                machine actionable.<a href="#clark-2016"> </a></p>

            <p> The scalability of the BUOI will mainly depend on the 10 character object id-module
                and how restricted the permitted character set is. A character set restricted to
                e.g. [A-Za-z0-9] will still have a possible of 62<sup>10</sup> unique permutations,
                within each namespace and object-type, still better than the 7 character Handle with
                NOID. But if this will not be sufficient, the permitted character set will have to
                be expanded. It is also conceivable, to allow for integration of already existing
                identifier schemes, that a namespace sets its own character set and string-length
                restrictions, as long as these are declared in the validation schemas of that
                namespace or they have otherwise well-known validation algorithms. Now there are
                also narrow identifier namespaces that do not have as yet different object types
                defined, possibly since they comprise basically only one type of object. Such is the
                case basically for e.g. ISBNs and ISSNs. To allow also for these in the BUOI model,
                we suggest as default second module <em>'NOT'</em> = No Object Type. So we could
                have BUOIs expressing e.g. an IGSN, <em>International Geo Sample Number</em>
                <a href="#SESAR-2017"> </a>:</p>

            <pre><code><em>Example</em>: IGSN.NOT.IECUR0002.2005-03-31.gswa-library</code> 
            </pre>

            <p>The identifier should thus be fully validatable as a whole or in part (modules) in
                the corresponding namespace(s). Possibly the version and last two modules might be
                optional, but they are meant to offer built in data provenance. For organisation
                identifiers (org.ids), we are still awaiting a common standard like the ORCID for
                persons. Thus, the BUOI identifier should be right-truncatable so that the same
                object id from different dates and registrants could easily be searched for.</p>

            <p>The resulting BUOIS should be minted within the corresponding namespaces, who would
                also be the 'custodians' and resolving authorities of their BUOIS, responsible for
                their uniqueness within their namespace. Another task would be to monitor and assign
                sameAs-properties to these BUOIs when identical twins of the same 'thing' are
                detected in other namespaces.</p>

            <p>It has been suggested that in order <q>to build more connected, cross-linked and
                    digitially accessible Internet content</q> it is necessary <q>to assign
                    recognizable, persistent, globally unique, stable identifiers to ... data
                    objects.</q>
                <a href="#guralnick-2015"> </a>. The model proposed here for a BUOI aims to make it
                fully recognizable, universally unique, stable, but always in a well-known context,
                seldom alone, and with great potential for backup.</p>
