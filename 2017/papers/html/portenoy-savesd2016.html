      <h1>Abstract</h1>
			<p>
			Citation graphs between scholarly papers can be used to learn about the
			structure and development of scholarship. We present a generalizable
			approach to visualizing scholarly influence over time, using a dynamic
			node-link diagram representing the citation patterns between groups of
			papers. We combine this approach with hierarchical clustering techniques
			that exploit the network structure to partition the graph into clusters
			representing fields and subfields. We use these methods to explore the
			influence that fields have had on other fields over time.

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>
			Examining the scholarly literature as a vast network of ideas connected
			by citations and footnotes can yield insights into the flow and evolution
			of ideas. Understanding the structure of this network can help us
			understand the progression of science and the development of human
			knowledge. We present novel methods using dynamic network visualizations
			and graph clustering techniques to show patterns around the influence
			that scholarly fields have on other fields over time.
			</p>
			<p>
			The node-link diagram is a common paradigm for visually representing
			network data; however, these diagrams tend to be overwhelming and
			inscrutable to the average viewer, especially when representing rich
			dynamic data. Our approach is to use animation and a spiral placement of
			nodes around a fixed center to encode temporal features of the network,
			allowing for a more accessible display of rich information in a limited
			space.

    <section id="SectionMotivationAndBackground">
      <h1>Motivation and background</h1>
			<p>
			We were motivated to explore visualization methods of scholarly influence
			through a collaboration with the Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical
			Sciences, which provides early-career funding to prominent health
			researchers each year. The program wanted to reflect on its history using
			more than just standard metrics such as citation counts, h-indexes, and
			impact factors.
			</p>
			<p>
			We approached our work with the Pew program as a case study in narrative
			visualization, developing our methods according to the Pew program's goal
			of reflecting on their history while seeing a broader opportunity to use
			visualization to convey scholarly impact. We drew on previous work in
			visualizing citation networks<a href="#CoboTools">
			</a>, narrative visualizations<a href="#SegelNarrative"
			> </a>, and dynamic network visualizations<a
			href="#BeckSTAR"> </a> to provide ways of exploring
			dimensions of scholarly influence over time in an accessible and
			compelling format. We designed the visualization in collaboration with
			the Pew program leadership, and evaluated the design using demonstrations
			and interviews with Pew Scholars. A demonstration of the author-level
			visualization using sample data can be found at <a
			href="http://scholar.eigenfactor.org/demo">http://scholar.eigenfactor.org/demo</a>. We concluded
			from our evaluation that our design was an effective method of showing
			scholarly influence.
			</p>
			<p>
			In our current work, we explore shifting the focus from author
			to academic field. We partition the overall citation graph into fields
			and subfields (see <a href="#SectionData"></a>) and focus on
			one specific subfield as the center node. Extending our efforts
			visualizing the influence that one scholar has had within and outside of
			her research area over time, we hope to explore the influence that an
			idea in science has had over the course of its lifetime.

      <h1>Methods</h1>
			<section id="SectionData">
				<h1>Data</h1>
				<p>
				Our database of scholarly publications includes 1.7 million full-text
				articles from the JSTOR archive and more than 8 million citations
				between those articles. The methods for naming the fields are described
				in <a href="#WestGender"> </a>. We used the
				citation network–with papers as nodes and citations as
				links–and clustered the citation graph using the hierarchical
				version of the map equation <a href="#RosvallRandomWalks"> </a>. We then hand-labeled 1,765 fields and
				subfields from the hierarchical partition. We labeled the fields by
				looking at the top 50 papers in each field.  
				</p>
				<p>
				Papers were ranked using the Article-Level Eigenfactor Score (ALEF).
				The details of the ranking method can be found at <a
				href="#WestEigenfactor"> </a>. It takes into
				account the time-directedness of article-level networks. The ALEF
				algorithm has performed well in static ranking challenges <a
				href="#WesleySmithStaticRanking"> </a>. We used
				the article rankings for both the labeling and for identifying the
				influence of papers that cite the fields of focus (see <a
				href="#FigurePopulismVis"> </a>).  
				</p>
				<p>
				Currently, the visualization samples 6 fields. We plan to expand to all
				1,765 fields in the JSTOR dataset. Users will have the ability to move
				from field to field and from paper to paper. We plan also to cluster,
				label, and incorporate other paper archives, including SSRN, arXiv,
				etc.

						An example of the visualization for the field of "Progressive era
						American Populism". The center node represents all publications within
						this field. Nodes that appear around the center represent publications
						that cited work in this field. Node size shows a citation-based
						indicator (Eigenfactor<a href="#WestEigenfactor">
						</a>) of the paper's influence. Node color shows the high-level field
						of each paper (e.g. "Economics," "Sociology"). Integrated timeline
						charts below show number of publications in the field of focus, number
						of citations received by that field, and the sum of the Eigenfactor for
						all of that field's papers.

				<h1>Visualization design</h1>
				<p>
				<a href="#FigurePopulismVis"> </a> shows a screenshot of the
				final state of the visualization; the full, animated, interactive
				visualization for a sample of fields can be viewed at <a
				href="http://scholar.eigenfactor.org/fields">http://scholar.eigenfactor.org/fields</a>. We use the
				open-source JavaScript visualization library D3<a href="#BostockD3"
				> </a>, transforming the citation data into
				a directed egocentric network in which the center (ego) node represents
				all of the publications in a particular subfield and surrounding
				(alter) nodes represent individual papers from other fields that have
				cited work represented in the ego. (The code to generate the
				visualization will be made available in an open-source repository.) In
				the figure above, for example, the central subfield is "Progressive era
				American populism" which is part of the high-level field "History," and
				the alter nodes are papers in other subfields that have cited this
				field's papers. The graph diagram shows the ego node as a central
				circle, and the alter nodes as circles that surround the center in
				a spiral formation. The surrounding nodes appear one by one according
				to year of publication and send out links representing citations to the
				center and to other nodes that appear in the network. Papers that cite
				the central field multiple times send out multiple overlaid links to
				the center, so these links appear darker. A year counter shows the
				publication year of the papers currently appearing. As the nodes
				appear, the viewer can explore further by mousing over the nodes for
				more information. The viewer can also explore papers in the center
				field by mousing over the timeline charts below.
				</p>
				<p>
				While the total set of the nodes represents any paper that has ever
				cited a paper authored by the central field, in order to reduce the
				complexity of the graph we choose a sample of these nodes to visualize,
				aiming to include influential papers (based on Eigenfactor), from
				a variety of high-level fields. Currently, the number of nodes is
				capped at 275, though we are experimenting with alternatives. More
				complete statistics for the full egocentric network are shown in
				integrated timeline charts below the graph.
				</p>
				<p>
				We explore representing the idea of influence in several different
				ways, and so the network diagram features several different visual
				encodings of influence. The <em>size of the nodes</em> is scaled by the
				Eigenfactor metric of each paper, so that larger nodes are easily
				identified as more influential papers. The <em>color of the nodes</em>
				encodes the high-level field of the paper according to the paper's
				cluster assignment for the top-level partition (e.g. "Economics,"
				"Sociology"). This allows a view of to what extent this subdiscipline
				has had impact that has spread to other disciplines. A field with
				a more monochrome network will have had most of its influence within
				one particular field, while a network with more color means more
				citations from papers in other fields.
				</p>
				<p>
				We arrived at our design through an iterative design process with the
				overall goal of creating an accessible, narrative visualization of
				different dimensions of scholarly influence over time. The use of
				animation was an important design choice throughout the process, as
				animation naturally draws attention and can encourage perceptions of
				narrative. We chose the spiral for the spatial encoding as it allowed
				us to encode time of publication as radial distance from the center,
				reinforcing its temporal encoding with the animation. The spiral layout
				also allows us to include more nodes in a limited space without too
				much overlap and confusion, addressing the overwhelming "hairball"
				effect that often comes along with node-link network diagrams.

      <h1>Conclusions and Future directions</h1>
			<p>
			Visualizing the citation graph in this way with the focus on a particular
			subfield gives a gestalt view of the spread of influence the field has
			had over time. The work is in early stages, so we are still exploring
			what insights can come from examining different fields. Looking at the
			example in <a href="#FigurePopulismVis"> </a>, we can see that
			"Progressive era American populism" is a well established field with
			a history of publication going back to the 1800s. As may be expected, it
			has had a wide range of influence across many academic disciplines, as
			can be seen by the extent of the colors in the network diagram.
			</p>
			<p>
			We plan to use this work as a starting point to explore different ways of
			visualizing dynamic field-level influence using the citation
			network. We currently make use of the top and bottom levels of the
			cluster hierarchy, but we can explore ways to make use of the
			intermediate levels. We can also make use of other data, such as marking
			certain nodes as review articles, as these may have a different
			interpretation than primary research papers when thinking about
			influence. Another direction would be to switch the citation direction
			and, rather than looking at the influence that a field has had, visualize
			which papers and fields have influenced the field of interest.
